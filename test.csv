On Tuesday, the rupee rebounded from its all-time low levels and gained 22 paise to close at 91.68 against the US dollar.
Forex traders said the rupee opened higher as the US dollar index softened and a long-awaited trade breakthrough with Europe bolstered investor sentiment.
India and the European Union on Tuesday announced the conclusion of negotiations for the free trade agreement (FTA), under which a number of domestic sectors such as apparel, chemicals and footwear will get duty-free entry into the 27-nation bloc, while the EU will get access to the Indian market at concessional duty for cars and wines, an official said.
The deal has been dubbed the ""mother of all deals"" as it will create a market of about 2 billion people.
Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.07 per cent lower at 96.14.

livemint,markets,Dalal Street Reality Check: India-EU trade deal is historic but it can't replace India-US deal - here's why,"India's Free Trade Agreement with the EU, finalized on January 26, 2026, enhances trade relations and positions India favorably in global markets, but experts caution it does not replace the need for an India-US trade deal, which remains crucial for Indian exporters.",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/dalal-street-reality-check-india-eu-trade-deal-is-historic-but-it-cant-replace-india-us-trade-deal-explained-11769596183677.html,2026-01-28,"India-EU free trade agreement: India’s Free Trade Agreement with the European Union, finalised on January 26, 2026, marks one of the most consequential trade alliances in recent history. Covering economies that together represent nearly 25 % of global GDP and 33 % of global trade, the agreement is expected to accelerate India’s integration into global supply chains and strengthen its long-term export competitiveness.
Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist at CareEdge Ratings, believes the agreement will materially benefit India’s labour-intensive sectors and services exports, particularly through improved mobility, digital services access and deeper participation in global value chains. At the same time, she has cautioned that increased market access will expose domestic players to tougher competition, making execution and cost efficiency critical for listed companies.
Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital, has highlighted that while the EU deal expands opportunity, it also serves a different purpose — providing alternative markets for products traditionally exported to the US. The agreement helps hedge against US tariff uncertainty, but it does not replicate the earnings intensity or market depth that US exposure provides to Indian corporates.
Adding to this perspective, Munjal Almoula, Managing Partner – Tax & Regulatory Advisory at BDO India, has emphasised the strategic design of the pact. The India-EU FTA is structured as a “living agreement”, incorporating digital trade, advanced manufacturing collaboration and sustainability mechanisms. This enhances long-term competitiveness but also underscores why benefits will accrue over multiple years rather than trigger an immediate market rerating.
For investors, the takeaway is nuanced. The India-EU trade deal strengthens India’s long-term structural growth narrative, supports export-oriented manufacturing and reinforces the China-plus-one theme. Over time, this can translate into steadier earnings growth and improved global positioning for select sectors.
However, markets should not conflate strategic diversification with economic substitution. The US remains India’s most critical trade partner from an equity-market perspective, and any progress on an India-US trade deal would likely have a sharper and more immediate impact on earnings upgrades, foreign inflows and market sentiment.
In short, Brussels matters — but Washington still moves Dalal Street more decisively. The India-EU deal is a powerful complement, not a replacement, and investors would do well to position portfolios with that distinction firmly in mind.

Management expenses surged more than 45% to₹3,519 crore, largely due to a 28% increase in commissions and a 36.6% rise in employee-related expenses.
Assets under management (AUM) rose 16%, increasing from₹4,416.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, to₹5,117.1 billion as of December 31, 2025, with a debt–equity allocation of 59:41. Nearly 95% of the debt portfolio is invested in AAA-rated and sovereign instruments, the company said.

Individual New Business Premium grew by a healthy 13.5% year-on-year to₹225.5 billion in 9M FY26, reflecting steady demand across key product lines.
Overall growth remained robust, with Gross Written Premium (GWP) rising 20% year-on-year to₹733.5 billion in 9M FY26.

livemint,markets,Asian Paints: Why is investor confidence peeling off despite robust margins?,"Management highlighted changes in consumption patterns such as the growing number of destination weddings leading to postponement of home paintings in the wedding season, and less frequent painting in general as consumers shift to other discretionary spends.",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/asian-paints-q3-results-shares-fall-volume-growth-slows-11769589594777.html,2026-01-28,"Asian Paints Ltd’s shares fell around 5% on Wednesday after the company announced its earnings for the December quarter (Q3FY26). Though profit margins were a bright spot, the company failed to sustain its 10.9% growth in domestic decorative paint volume from Q2, which came after five quarters of lucklustre growth.
Domestic decorative paint volume, Asian Paints’s backbone, grew 7.9% year-on-year In Q3, with value growth at 2.8%. A shorter festive period (just 15 days) and a prolonged monsoon in October played spoilsport. Consolidated revenue grew just 3.7% year-on-year to₹8,867 crore.
Management said in the earnings call that volumes in November and December were significantly stronger than the quarterly average, suggesting an improving trend towards the end of Q3. Near-term volume growth is seen at 8-10%, aided by steady demand from both the consumer and industrial segments.
That said, management highlighted changes in consumption patterns such as the growing number of destination weddings leading to postponement of home paintings in the wedding season, and less frequent painting in general as consumers shift to other discretionary spends. These are likely leading to weak industry sales growth compared to the healthy double-digit growth of the past.
Asian Paints’ volume-value gap of 4-5% is likely to persist because of an unfavourable product mix (higher growth is likely in putty, construction chemicals and waterproofing products). This could limit overall revenue growth to the mid-single-digits.
Gross margin and Ebitda margin both hit multi-quarter highs in Q3. Gross margin at 44.4% was aided by lower raw material costs and a larger share of premium products. Ebitda margin surpassed 20% for the first time in eight quarters. Asian Paints retained its Ebitda margin guidance of 18-20%, supported by continued cost efficiencies, stable input prices, and benefits expected from backward integration projects over the medium-term.
Nomura Global Markets Research analysts said the company could see operating margin remain at the higher-end of the guided band. However, its near-term guidance of mid-single-digit value growth and double-digit volume growth may not excite the Street, said the Nomura report dated 27 January. Factoring in the guidance, Nomura cut its FY27 and FY28 earnings per share estimates by 2.4% and 0.2%, respectively.
Asian Paints will continue to invest in marketing and strengthen brand equity as it expects competition to remain elevated. It currently does not foresee price changes, but is confident of market-share gains through innovation. It continues to expand its distribution reach, having added 3,500-4,000 retailers over 9MFY26 with more than 160,000 retail touchpoints.

According to a CNBC report, LVMH's October to December quarter (Q4) results failed to beat investor expectations, which set a higher bar for the luxury goods conglomerate after strong earnings from competitors.

“Once again in 2025, LVMH demonstrated its solidity and effective strategy upheld by its highly engaged teams. The group was buoyed by the loyalty and growing demand shown by our local customers. This momentum was once again underpinned by the powerful desirability of our brands, which embody creative passion and the pursuit of the utmost quality, and by our ambition of offering our customers extraordinary stores and cultural experiences,” said Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH in the official statement.
LVMH stock was trading 7.23% lower at 546.80 euros as of 11:25 am (CST) on Wednesday, compared to 589.30 euros at the previous stock market close, MarketWatch data shows.

Extending gains to the second consecutive session, the Sensex settled 487 points, or 0.60%, higher at 82,344.68, while the Nifty 50 closed the day at 25,342.75, rising 167 points, or 0.66%.
The mid and small-cap segments outperformed as the BSE Midcap 150 index jumped 1.69%, while the Smallcap 250 index surged 1.81%.
Strong gains in the market made investors richer by about₹6 lakh crore in a single session as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms jumped to nearly₹460 lakh crore from nearly₹454 lakh crore in the previous session.
The domestic market saw healthy gains on short covering as an India-EU free trade agreement influenced sentiment.
""Domestic markets displayed continued optimism, supported by the India–EU FTA,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, noted.
Ajit Mishra, SVP- Research at Religare Broking, said apart from the continued rub-off from the India–EU FTA, positive global cues, including a weaker U.S. dollar and supportive moves in global indices, helped bolster sentiment.
""Short-covering and renewed buying interest across sectors added to the positive momentum, while company-specific triggers, including notable gains in select heavyweight stocks, further supported the upside,"" Mishra said.
As many as 32 stocks ended higher in the Nifty 50 index, among which Bharat Electronics (BEL) (up 9.21%), ONGC (up 8.18%), and Coal India (up 5.27%) ended at the top.
Tata Consumer (down 4.55%), Asian Paints (down 4.22%), and Maruti Suzuki India (down 2.39%) ended as the top losers in the index.
Barring Nifty FMCG (down 0.71%), Pharma (down 0.22%), and Healthcare (down 0.20%), all sectoral indices ended higher.
Nifty Oil and Gas (up 3.40%) ended at the top, followed by Metal (up 2.34%), Media (up 2.13%), PSU Bank (up 1.68%), and Realty (up 1.57%).
Nifty Bank jumped 0.66% to end at 59,598.80. The Financial Services index rose by 1%.
Vodafone Idea (64.5 crore shares), Tata Silver Exchange Traded Fund (64 crore shares), and Tata Gold Exchange Traded Fund (27.4 crore shares) were the most active counters in terms of volume on the NSE.
The advance-decline ratio remained in favour of advancers as over 2,900 stocks advanced while over 1,300 declined on the BSE.
Sterlite Technologies, Redtape, Mahindra Logistics, Shilchar Technologies, Paras Petrofils, Omax Autos, Meera Industries, and Infobeans Technologies were among the 17 stocks that jumped more than 15% on the BSE.
Axis Bank, BEL, SBI, Tata Steel, and Tech Mahindra were among the 86 stocks that hit their 52-week highs in intraday trade on the BSE.
As many as 261 stocks, including Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Patanjali Foods, Syngene International, Brigade Enterprises, Jyothy Labs, and Akzo Nobel India, hit their 52-week lows on the BSE.
According to Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, 25,200 would act as a key support level for the Nifty 50. Above this level, the pullback rally could continue till 25,500.
Chouhan said further upside may also continue, potentially lifting the index to 25,575. However, below 25,200, sentiment could change, and traders may prefer to exit their long positions.
Mishra of Religare Broking pointed out that the Nifty settled at a crucial juncture around the 25,350 level, and a decisive breakout could help extend the rebound towards the 25,600 zone.
On the downside, the long-term moving average, the 200 DEMA around 25,150, remains critical to hold; a breakdown below this level could see the corrective phase resume, Mishra said.

""For the first time in years, the fog has cleared, allowing the business to look beyond survival and focus on sustainable growth,"" Birla wrote.
Vodafone Idea, created following the merger of UK-based Vodafone and India's Idea Cellular in 2018, has weathered a long-period of uncertainty in India’s telecom history.
Burdened by AGR dues, intense competition, and operational challenges, Vodafone Idea’s future was uncertain, raising broader concerns about the country’s telecom sector.
Vodafone Idea got a breather from the government on payment of its AGR dues as the Cabinet decided to freeze them at₹87,695 crore. The government had approved the payment plan for the company to clear its frozen AGR dues between FY32 and FY41.
As per the Supreme Court orders in October and November, the government has also begun the exercise to reassess the company's AGR dues. Upon completion of the exercise, the final AGR amount of the company could be reduced as well, according to analysts and government officials.
""The Vodafone Idea experience underlines my belief that Tough Times Don’t Last. Tough Companies Do,"" Birla wrote, attributing the commitment of employees, loyalty of customers and the belief of business partners and shareholders as the factors that carried Vodafone Idea through this turbulent and uncertain time in the company's history.
""Equally vital was the government’s unflinching determination to revitalise the telecom sector, coupled with the firm conviction of the promoters on the long-term potential of the Indian telecom sector. A dogged focus on daily operations, service and network expansion, will now serve as the foundation for revival,"" he said.
Birla emphasised the strategic importance of a competitive telecom industry for India’s digital future.
He stated, “A healthy, competitive telecom industry is essential to India’s digital future. India deserves 3 private telecom players. India deserves a successful Vodafone Idea. And this is, once again, an idea whose time has come.""
During the quarter, the company lost 3.8 million subscribers, taking its subscriber base to 192.9 million as of the end of December. Meanwhile, its average revenue per user (Arpu) grew 3% sequentially to₹172 a month, led by consumer upgrades.

Silver ETFs mirrored the rally in the underlying metal. Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, Zerodha Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Silver ETF and Nippon India Silver ETF gained over 6% each during the session.
Meanwhile, 360 ONE Silver ETF, Groww Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF and several others advanced more than 5%.
Commenting on the outlook, Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst at IndusInd Securities, said silver ETF prices could remain volatile in the near term, potentially moving more sharply than spot silver if leveraged or sentiment-driven flows intensify.
“Structural supply constraints, as silver is largely a by-product of other metals and cannot be easily ramped up, continue to support prices. Strong industrial demand from sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles, electronics and emerging technology applications, along with safe-haven buying amid macroeconomic uncertainty and low or negative real yields, are further positives,” Trivedi said.
According to Trivedi, the overall outlook for silver remains bullish, and silver ETFs are likely to continue witnessing healthy investor inflows.
Silver prices have significantly outpaced gold prices. While demand for silver was earlier driven largely by rising industrial consumption, investment demand has emerged as a key driver in recent months
Reflecting this trend, silver ETFs recorded inflows of₹234.7 billion in 2025, sharply higher than₹85.69 billion in the previous year. The growing popularity of silver ETFs indicates that imports for investment purposes could increase further if the ongoing price rally sustains.

livemint,markets,Budget day trading guide: Should you stay on the sidelines ahead of the mega event? Explained,"As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, experts weigh in on potential market impacts. With mixed earnings and geopolitical tensions, selective buying may be the strategy for traders, while long-term investors are advised to tread carefully.&amp;nbsp;",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/budget-2026-day-trading-strategy-should-you-stay-on-the-sidelines-ahead-of-the-mega-event-explained-11769588605751.html,2026-01-28,"While mixed Q3 earnings, FII selling, and geopolitical noise dominate market sentiment, the Budget remains a strong factor for the domestic market.
Investors and traders appear busy speculating what their trading and investing strategy should be for the Budget day.
Experts say the Union Budget is expected to focus on growth and fiscal consolidation. However, it may not have strong measures to boost consumption. Policy announcements may not trigger a sharp up-move in the market unless there is significant tax relief.
""Announcements on the housing front, especially affordable housing and taxation relief to FPIs, can change market sentiment,"" said Pankaj Pandey, the head of research at ICICI Securities.
Experts say that the market is witnessing stock-specific behaviour amid the Q3 results season. They suggest long-term investors should remain on the sidelines ahead of the Budget.
""This appears to be a stock-picker’s market, which is more suited for traders. Long-term investors should remain on the sidelines for now, given the lack of clarity on key macro issues, particularly the India–US trade deal,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments.
Vijayakumar said investors who are willing to take selective exposure can focus on domestic-centric sectors such as defence and capital goods.
""These sectors are less dependent on global trade and could benefit from domestic policy support and government spending,"" said Vijayakumar.
According to Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, investors can consider selective buying in equities.
""The Budget could offer better entry levels if there is disappointment, especially since the market is not expecting major reforms. Expectations are quite muted—otherwise, we would have seen a pre-Budget rally, which hasn’t happened,"" Mishra said.
The market is also expecting selective sectoral support, particularly for beaten-down sectors like textiles and export-oriented industries.
Mishra believes developments such as the EU–India trade deal and targeted Budget support could serve as short-term catalysts for these sectors.
""The market is currently focused on corporate earnings, which have been mixed this quarter. As a result, a selective investment approach is more suitable,"" said Mishra.
Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services believes there may be focus on higher capex across sectors such as defense, infrastructure, affordable housing, power, capital goods, etc..
Higher allocation to the PMAY scheme and an increase in government capex may benefit some cement stocks, Motilal Oswal said.
Measures such as a reduction of LTCG, the reintroduction of indexation benefit for debt mutual funds, no further increase in STT, and further tax slab widening and higher standard deduction may benefit AMCs, RTAs, and wealth managers, said Motilal Oswal.
According to Motilal Oswal, the following key stocks and sectors are likely to benefit if expectations play out:
L&T, ABB, Siemens, Hitachi, Siemens Energy, KEC, Bharat Electronics, Bharat Dynamics, HAL, Ultratech, JK Cement, Polycab, KEI, Crompton, Titan, PN Gadgil, Niva Bupa, AMCs, RTAs, most HFCs, MFIs, Infra players, IGL, Mahanagr Gas, Gujarat Gas, Petronet LNG, GAIL, Waaree, Premier, NTPC, Tata Power, Acme, NTPC Green, Brigade, Prestige, Sobha, Lodha, and Godrej Properties.

In the same period last year, the company had reported a net profit of₹1,092 crore.
The sharp drop in net profit for the quarter can be attributed to a significant rise in operating expenses, which jumped to₹6,114 crore from₹5,143.85 crore in the same period last year. Net profit was also impacted by a one-time charge of₹50 crore related to the implementation of the new labour codes.
The company reported revenue from operations rising to₹6,391 crore, up 21.7% year-on-year from₹5,251 crore in Q2FY25.
Its operating performance showed notable improvement during the quarter, with the company posting an EBITDA of₹608 crore, a strong 53.5% YoY increase.

Mr Vinod Bahety, Whole-Time Director & CEO, ACC Limited, said, ""We have sustained our growth momentum with another strong quarter, delivering our highest ever quarterly volumes. Higher trade and premium cement sales, alongside continued expansion in RMX, have supported better realizations than industry peers and strengthened our market position in core regions.""

They identify key sectors and stocks that could thrive under the proposed policy directions amidst external risks.",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/budget-picks-2026-axis-securities-lists-maruti-suzuki-ultratech-bharti-airtel-among-top-stocks-to-buy-ahead-of-feb-1-11769587094049.html,2026-01-28,"Union Budget 2026 Picks: As the Union Budget for FY2026–27 approaches, market participants are bracing for a policy event that could once again influence sectoral leadership and medium-term market trends.
According to Axis Securities, India enters the budget season with relatively strong domestic fundamentals, even as global growth remains uneven amid geopolitical risks, tighter financial conditions and slowing external demand. The brokerage said investors are likely to focus on whether the government can sustain growth momentum without diluting its fiscal consolidation path.
In its pre-Budget note, Axis Securities identified a set of stocks it believes are well positioned to benefit from the government’s policy priorities.
Axis Securities also highlighted several thematic plays outside its core coverage universe, including GMDC as a rare-earths opportunity, BEL and MTAR in defence manufacturing, Amara Raja Energy in the EV ecosystem, CESE as a power reform play, and M&M Finance as a credit growth beneficiary. “Capital expenditure remains the cornerstone of India’s growth strategy,” the brokerage said, adding that sectors linked to infrastructure, manufacturing and energy transition are likely to remain in focus.
From a sectoral lens, Axis Securities expects autos and ancillaries to benefit from higher disposable incomes and stable tax structures, while banks and NBFCs could see improved credit demand from capex-led growth and MSME support measures. Infrastructure-linked sectors such as cement, metals, power and construction remain key beneficiaries, while healthcare, hospitality and telecom could gain from targeted policy support and structural tailwinds.
On the macro front, Axis Securities expects the government to allocate around₹12–13 trillion toward capital expenditure in the Union Budget 2026–27, implying a 10–15% year-on-year increase. Roads, railways, logistics infrastructure, defence indigenisation, urban infrastructure, housing, power transmission and renewable energy are likely to be key beneficiaries. The brokerage noted that sustained public capex has been instrumental in crowding in private investment and supporting earnings visibility across core sectors.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to remain a key anchor for markets. Axis Securities said the government is likely to target a fiscal deficit of around 4.2–4.4% of GDP for FY27, which would reinforce policy credibility and help contain bond yields and inflation expectations. Disinvestment and asset monetisation could play a larger role in non-tax revenue generation, with potential proceeds estimated at₹50,000–70,000 crore, although execution remains a monitorable.
Overall, Axis Securities said the Union Budget 2026–27 is likely to strike a balance between growth support and macro stability, a combination that could keep India favourably positioned within global equity allocations despite persistent external uncertainties.

Anshul advises that traders should anchor stops tightly around the pivot and look for follow-through volume to confirm continuation.

livemint,markets,India–EU free trade agreement finalised. Can it accelerate an India-US trade deal?,"After nearly two decades of negotiations, the India-EU free trade agreement has been finalised, igniting speculation about a potential India-US trade deal. Experts debate whether this new agreement could influence US tariffs and trade negotiations.",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/indiaeu-free-trade-agreement-finalised-can-it-accelerate-an-india-us-trade-deal-11769154632124.html,2026-01-28,"India and the European Union (EU) have entered into a landmark free trade agreement that will further open India's markets to European goods.
The EU, which accounts for 25% of global GDP and 33% of global trade, is one of India's biggest trade partners. The India-EU trade deal is expected to further strengthen collaboration between the two major economies of the world across key policy areas such as trade, security, and defence.
While the deal is a significant positive development for the Indian economy and the stock market, investors' focus remains on the India-US trade deal front, as the US, according to reports, remains India's largest trade partner.
At first glance, the logic appears compelling that an India-EU FTA may nudge the US to finalise a long-stuck trade deal with India. Due to geopolitical and geoeconomic reasons, India remains a key strategic partner for the US.
Experts say that from a geopolitical standpoint, deeper trade ties with India remain important for the US. However, it is difficult to assume that India's trade deals with other major economies will put pressure on the US to accelerate a deal with New Delhi.
Some experts believe that the India-EU trade deal may prompt the US to reconsider its tariffs on India.
""With this new India-EU FTA after dragging for almost two decades, there are hopes that now the US will also be under some kind of compulsion to close a deal with New Delhi,"" said Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist and Executive Director, Anand Rathi Group.
A trade deal between India and the US remains stuck due to complex political, economic, and strategic issues.
The US has been pushing India on greater market access for agriculture, medical devices, digital trade rules, and labour and environmental standards. Moreover, lately, Trump has been harshly criticising India for buying Russian oil.
India, on the other hand, remains determined to safeguard its farmers and the agriculture sector from increased US imports. New Delhi has also been firmly reiterating that it will prioritise its national interests.
There have been several occasions over the last few months when both countries have signalled that a deal was imminent. However, despite multiple rounds of negotiations, a final India-US trade deal remains elusive.
""It is possible that Trump may be further infuriated by this India-EU deal, and he might put even more conditions on India,"" VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments, said.
India runs a sizeable trade surplus with Washington, and experts feel a bilateral trade deal would likely require New Delhi to offer meaningful concessions to narrow this trade imbalance.
With a deal with the EU, India has sent a signal that it is willing to move beyond a defensive trade policy and pursue comprehensive agreements.
However, a deal with the US may ultimately depend on how policies in both countries shift, evolving geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine war, and sectoral trade-offs.
""An India–US trade deal will depend more on New Delhi’s willingness to liberalise further and Washington’s readiness to compromise. India’s trade policy is becoming more outward-looking, which is a structural positive for long-term growth,"" said Vijayakumar.

The growth rate looks impressive partly because Q3FY25 profitability had suffered due to high input prices of tea, which were passed on in Q4FY25.
The volatility in the tea business has compelled Tata Consumer to stay focused on the performance of ‘growth’ businesses, which are essentially the branded segments in India other than tea and salt. They include Tata Sampann, Tata Soulfull, ready-to-drink (RTD) products (Tata Gluco+, Tata Copper+, Himalayan), Capital Foods (Ching’s Secret and Smith & Jones) and Organic India.
In Q3FY26, the growth businesses clocked the highest revenue increase in at least the past seven quarters, at 29%. This was largely volume-led growth across categories with Tata Sampann at 45% and RTD at 26% the notable ones.
The growth businesses have now achieved a quarterly run-rate of₹1,000 crore, though their profitability has not been disclosed separately. The company maintains the common cost overheads across all businesses makes it difficult to ascertain the Ebitda margin for each business.
However, the international Ebit margin fell by 167 bps to 12.3% as higher coffee prices hurt profitability. The company increased coffee prices in January to pass on the higher raw material costs, which should help in increasing the Ebit margin in Q4.
Investors must also see the valuation premium in the context of the former’s projected FY28 RoE at 10% versus the latter’s 26%.

For investors in India, the decision will be announced at 12:30 a.m. IST, which is an hour later than the normal timing due to Daylight Saving Time in the US.
Those awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks after the FOMC policy decision can tune in at 1:00 a.m. IST on Thursday, according to the official schedule.
Indian investors can also track Powell's speech on the above given official website links.
The FOMC has cut interest rates by 25 basis points in each of its past three meetings to prevent a cooling labour market from sliding into rising unemployment. The committee is now scheduled to meet this week to determine whether to reduce the federal funds rate further from its current range of 3.5%–3.75%.
Akshat Garg, Head - Research & Product at Choice Wealth, said that all signs point to the central bank hitting the pause button at this week's meeting, likely holding rates steady in the 3.50%–3.75% range.
He advised investors to think of this as a strategic ""wait-and-see"" moment rather than a change in direction. After aggressively cutting rates late last year, Chair Powell and his team need a moment to catch their breath and let those previous adjustments actually work their way through the plumbing of the economy, he said.
“A pause would align with the Fed’s data-dependent approach, allowing policymakers to evaluate whether recent disinflation is durable while monitoring signs of economic cooling. Inflation has eased from prior peaks but remains above the Fed’s 2% goal, reinforcing the need for caution against premature easing. Meanwhile, consumer spending remains steady, employment conditions are relatively tight, and financial markets have loosened modestly on expectations of future cuts,” said Seema Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities.
Srivastava further explained that this stance also tempers overly aggressive market bets on near-term cuts, keeping financial conditions aligned with policy objectives.
“Ultimately, a status-quo decision would reaffirm the Fed’s commitment to prudent monetary stewardship, emphasising that future moves will be guided by economic evidence rather than short-term sentiment or external pressures,” she added.
Furthermore, Garg expects Powell to signal that while the cutting cycle isn't dead, the Fed is perfectly comfortable sitting on its hands until the economic picture clears up.

livemint,markets,"As FPIs retreat ahead of Budget, can fiscal prudence revive market momentum?","For the fourth year running, FPIs are hitting the exit button ahead of the Union Budget. Yet, experts suggest this retreat is more about valuation arbitrage than a loss of faith in India’s long-term policy roadmap",https://www.livemint.com/market/union-budget-stock-market-fpis-selling-indian-equities-diis-vs-fpis-11769575071187.html,2026-01-28,"For four years now, January on Dalal Street has followed a predictable beat. Since 2023, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have used the pre-Budget weeks to retreat, seeking safety elsewhere. This year is no different.
FPIs have been on a selling spree since November, with sharp outflows of over₹36,000 crore so far in 2026 against₹78,027 crore a year ago.
In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) have transitioned from secondary players to the primary engines of the capital markets. Propelled by a steady stream of retail systematic investment plans (SIPs), they continue to pour liquidity into Indian equities. Does this suggest the Union Budget has become a mere domestic event?
“The Union Budget remains one of the most critical domestic events, not just for equity markets but for the entire financial ecosystem, as it sets the direction for long-term policy goals while outlining milestones for sustained economic growth,"" highlights Ajit Mishra, SVP, research, Religare Broking.
So what's in store for this year? With uneven global growth and moderating consumption, a tighter fiscal strategy is required, which naturally lowers market expectations. The government faces a strict fiscal glide path, leaving little room for a significant expansion in capital expenditure. “One of the key challenges for Budget 2026–27 is balancing capex-led growth with consumption support,"" notes an Axis Direct report
Mishra noted that with the government committed to maintaining the fiscal deficit around 4.3–4.4%, the scope for large populist measures is limited without risking fiscal credibility. “After several years of strong growth, infrastructure spending is expected to moderate as execution capacity peaks,"" he added.
Rather than headline-grabbing measures, experts believe the market is prioritising a Budget rooted in fiscal prudence and tax certainty, a strategy that would serve as a crucial buffer against an increasingly uncertain global backdrop.
The central government’s fiscal situation remained stretched in FY26, mainly due to weak tax collections. Tax collections remained muted during April-November 2025 and constituted 54.7% of FY26 budgeted estimates, which was significantly lower than the average value of 59.5% during the last four years, according to a JM Financial report.
This uncertainty has left investors on edge. They are unsure whether the upcoming Budget announcements could be the catalyst that breaks the current deadlock and sets the market's path for next month.
Historical data supports this hesitation, as Budget Day rallies have been rare; performance remains largely mixed with no consistent pattern of 'pre' or 'post' Budget gains. “The Budget could spark a recovery if meaningful tax relief is extended to investors—such as on STT or LTCG,"" Mishra said. “Or lead to consolidation if fiscal discipline remains the overriding priority.""
Given that the Budget is primarily aimed at setting long-term growth policies, it is unlikely to alter the short-term market trajectory. In the near term, the market will take cues from corporate earnings, trade developments, and the evolving geopolitical landscape, he added.

The small-cap stock surged as much as 10% to₹38.94 apiece on the BSE.
The order is worth₹114.10 crore and the time period by which the order is to be executed is 10 months, MIC Electronics said in a regulatory filing on January 28.
The company added that it was a direct order, wherein it participated through the tender route.
Meanwhile, MIC Electronics said its board of directors will consider and approve financial results for the third quarter of FY26 on Saturday, January 31, 2026.
MIC Electronics share price has staged a rebound after correcting nearly 59% in just 94 days, but the current move carries all the hallmarks of a dead cat bounce rather than a structural reversal, noted Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments.
“The bounce has begun on relatively muted volumes, well below what is typically seen in sustainable recoveries, highlighting a lack of strong participation. Price structure on higher timeframes remains damaged, with lower highs firmly intact. This rebound is likely to be short-lived, potentially lasting three to five sessions, and is expected to retrace into the unmitigated supply zone around₹45 to₹46. That area is likely to attract fresh selling pressure as trapped longs look to exit,” said Jain.
Unless volume expands meaningfully and structure improves, the move should be treated as corrective, with risk–reward still favoring the downside once the bounce exhausts, he added.
MIC Electronics share price has fallen over 13% in one month and has declined 30% in three months. The smallcap stock has dropped 45% in one year, but has delivered multibagger returns of 3,473% over the past five years.

As per the filing, this arrangement will be especially focused on the Krishna Godavari basin and the Andaman offshore region. ONGC stated that this represents a significant advancement toward cost optimization, expedited execution, and enhanced asset utilization in complex deepwater initiatives.
ONGC stated that the agreement is in line with the initiative promoted by the Oilfields Amendment Act, 2025, introduced by the petroleum ministry, which establishes a clear framework for exploration and production operators to share infrastructure and facilities, both onshore and offshore, facilitating the development of oilfields and the production of hydrocarbons.
As part of this initiative from the ministry, ONGC and Reliance will work together to share essential resources needed for offshore operations, which may include onshore and offshore processing, facilities, drilling rigs, marine vessels, power sources, pipelines, logging, and well services, as indicated by the company.
ONGC stated that the agreement is anticipated to yield quantifiable advantages through a systematic framework for the collective use of essential assets and capabilities, including:
ONGC shares have been on the rise since the early hours of Wednesday, following an increase in crude oil prices to a four-month peak in global markets.
According to reports, brent crude has surged to nearly $68 per barrel, achieving a four-month high, spurred by a weakening US Dollar and heightened tensions regarding possible US military actions against Iran.
The rise in oil prices benefits upstream oil companies like ONGC and Oil India, as a one dollar increase in price can boost the annual revenue for each of these companies by₹300 crore to₹400 crore, according to reports.
ONCG share price opened at an intraday low of₹249 apiece on the BSE, the stock touched an intraday high (52-week high) of₹269.30 apiece.
Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical and Derivative Analyst at Angel One, said that ONCG shares have witnessed a strong move, breaking out of a prolonged consolidation phase. In the near term, prices are likely to extend this up-move towards the 310 levels. On the downside, the breakout zone around 255 is expected to act as an immediate buying area and strong support.
Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree, added ONCG share price that has delivered a decisive breakout from a 63-week rectangle bounded by 215 and 254, confirming a higher-timeframe trend shift.
“Any shallow pullback toward the breakout area should act as support, while a sustained move back below 254 would be the key invalidation. Trend strength favors follow-through as long as participation remains elevated, ” said Jain.
RIL share price today opened at an intraday low of₹1,383.30 apiece on the BSE, the stock touched an intraday high of₹1,409.70 per share.
According to Rajesh Bhosale, RIL shares are currently hovering near the October swing low, a zone from where a strong rally was earlier witnessed. Some respite buying is visible, leading to a mild bounce.
“The 1,340–1,350 zone remains a crucial support. On the upside, the bounce may extend further, with the 200-DSMA around 1,440 acting as an immediate resistance,” said Bhosale.

He acknowledged selling some Bitcoin and gold for a new home, while advocating for real estate investments to generate cash flow and maintain silver holdings.",https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/thank-god-i-did-not-sell-my-silver-robert-kiyosaki-clears-the-air-as-silver-rate-gold-price-bull-run-continues-11769582052470.html,2026-01-28,"In his latest post on social media platform X, Kiyosaki explained that while he had sold some Bitcoin and some gold, the proceeds were used to buy a new home—not to rotate entirely into crypto.
“Selling some gold and some Bitcoin was my mistake… a big mistake. Thank God I did not sell my silver,” he wrote, underlining his conviction that silver continues to offer structural and monetary value in a world he believes is heading toward deeper financial stress.
Kiyosaki’s clarification comes against the backdrop of an earlier disclosure made in November, when he revealed that he had sold $2.25 million worth of Bitcoin for roughly $90,000 in cash. The headline figure raised eyebrows, but Kiyosaki maintained that the move was not bearish on Bitcoin. He said he had originally bought Bitcoin at around $6,000 per coin years ago and was simply reallocating gains into cash-flow-generating assets.
“With the cash from Bitcoin, I am purchasing two surgery centres and investing in a billboard business,” Kiyosaki wrote at the time, adding that these investments were expected to generate positive cash flow of about $27,500 a month by February, largely tax-free.
Around the same time, Kiyosaki once again warned that the “biggest crash in history” was already unfolding across the US, Europe and Asia. He argued that excessive debt, weak monetary discipline and policy missteps by central banks were eroding confidence in fiat currencies. Against this backdrop, he urged investors to move quickly into what he considers safer alternatives—gold, silver, Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Silver, however, stands out in his worldview. Kiyosaki has repeatedly described it as the most undervalued and safest asset in the current cycle. “Silver is $50 today. I predict silver will hit $70 soon and possibly $200 in 2026,” he said in an earlier post, making one of the most aggressive bullish calls on the white metal.
Recent price action has added fuel to Kiyosaki’s thesis. Silver rose nearly 3% to close near record highs above $117 an ounce, while spot silver hovered around $113.63 after touching $117.69 earlier in the week. The metal is already up close to 60% this year, supported by strong investment demand, tight supply and a weaker US dollar.
Gold, too, has surged to fresh records, breaking past $5,200 an ounce and rising more than 20% since the start of the year. Kiyosaki has welcomed the rally, reiterating his belief that fiat currencies are steadily losing purchasing power. He has even floated a long-term gold target of $27,000, calling the current move validation of his decades-long warnings.
Kiyosaki argued that short-term price movements are irrelevant when the long-term trend of currency debasement is clear. He framed his argument around the steady rise in US national debt and the erosion of the US dollar’s purchasing power, linking the problem to policy decisions taken by highly educated policymakers running institutions such as the US Federal Reserve and the Treasury.

Shadowfax Technologies IPO listing date was today, 28 January 2026, and the stock has been listed on both the stock exchanges, BSE and NSE.
Shadowfax Technologies shares were listed at₹113 apiece on the BSE, a discount of 8.87% to the issue price of₹124 apiece on the BSE. The stock was listed with a discount of 9.19% at₹112.60 apiece on the NSE.
Shadowfax Technologies IPO listing indicates a cautious investor sentiment towards the logistics and new-age business space.
“The discounted listing suggests valuation concerns, and Shadowfax Technologies shares may remain volatile or range-bound in the near term as markets focus on profitability, cash flows, and execution,” said Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart Ltd.
She recommends Shadowfax Technologies IPO allottees to hold the stock with a strict stop loss at₹105 to protect downside risk.
“Fresh investors should avoid immediate entry and consider buying only after price stability, with a similar stop loss of₹104 –₹105. On the upside, the₹120 –₹124 zone is likely to act as a resistance in the short term,” said Nyati.
Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk noted that Shadowfax Technologies shares’ muted listing reflects valuation fatigue in the IPO market rather than doubts over the business.
“While the company boasts strong revenue growth and a pan-India logistics network, weak non-institutional demand and thin listing sentiment capped upside. Near-term stock performance will now hinge on execution, margin improvement and sustained profitability rather than growth alone,” said Garg.

livemint,markets,"Missed up to 200% gold, silver price rally? Worry not. This metal could emerge as a good bet this year","Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead, VT Markets, said that for investors who missed the precious metals rally, copper is increasingly viewed as a strategic opportunity rather than a speculative chase.",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/missed-up-to-200-gold-silver-price-rally-worry-not-this-metal-could-emerge-as-a-good-bet-this-year-11769579943438.html,2026-01-28,"Investors are increasingly questioning the sustainability of the rally in gold and silver amid the linear surge in rates, and are increasingly looking for alternative metals to bet on. As per analysts, copper can emerge as a worthy candidate.
Copper, which is being referred to as “the next gold”, is likely to continue its bull regime in 2026, said Heena Naik, Research Analyst - Commodities, Angel One.
In the last year, copper prices have surged 50% in the domestic spot market, largely driven by tariffs unleashed by the US and major mine outages.
In July of 2025, the US President announced universal 50% tariffs on imports of 51 types of semi-finished copper products, excluding raw copper materials. Goldman Sachs Research’s base case is that a 15% tariff will be announced in mid-2026 on refined copper, which has already led to many buyers stockpiling copper in the US in advance of the expected import tax, creating expectations of temporary scarcity outside of the US, opined Naik.
The diversion of LME stocks to the US market has led to low inventories in China, Russia and European LME warehouses. This temporary scarcity outside of the US is leaving everyone else short of metal, causing a huge arbitrage gap, she added.
Apart from this, there were three major mine outages in 2025, which fuelled the bull run in copper prices. Years of underinvestment, declining ore grades in Chile and Peru, and project delays have further tightened the market, keeping inventories near multi-year lows across major exchanges.
The Grassberg Block Cave portion of the mine, which accounts for 70% of previously forecasted production, is expected to remain closed until the second quarter of 2026. In addition, production in Chile and Peru has also been affected due to labour problems and protests, compounding the supply shortage.
""Adding to supply woes, declining ore grades and years of underinvestment have limited miners' ability to meet growing demand quickly. Another sign of stress in copper right now is the concentrate market, where smelters are increasingly competing for raw copper material that becomes refined copper. Nonetheless, the copper tariff risk remains, which is likely to influence the prices of copper in 2026,"" Angel One analyst opined.
Copper demand, meanwhile, continues to boom as it is a direct play on global electrification, energy transition, and infrastructure spending. Naik said that the supply disruption issues are going to continue at least till mid-2026 which shall continue to influence copper prices.
With EV penetration rising, grid expansion accelerating, and renewable capacity additions scaling up, copper demand growth is now structurally higher than it was in the last cycle, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS.
He believes that while copper prices have already moved meaningfully, the cycle does not appear stretched yet.
Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead, VT Markets, said that for investors who missed the precious metals rally, copper is increasingly viewed as a strategic opportunity rather than a speculative chase. He observed that in an environment characterised by strong demand and limited supply, any incremental demand can trigger a disproportionate acceleration in prices.
Analysts said that copper should be seen not as a short-term trade, but as a strategic allocation aligned with the next phase of global industrial and energy transformation.
""It is important to note that copper is less driven by macro uncertainty and more about industrial demand, making it complementary to gold and silver rather than a direct replacement,"" said Maxwell.
Over the medium term, a sustained global electrification cycle could support copper moving higher by 25–40% above historical averages, Maxwell projected.
Sharing a price target for copper, Naik said the speculative peak in copper prices is likely to continue in the coming days due to US economic growth, AI spending, and US stockpiling. ""MCX Copper Feb Futures is likely to surge towards₹1365 per kg in the near-term. Break of same could push the metal towards₹1410 per kg,"" she opined. MCX copper futures traded 1% higher at₹1328.95 per kg on January 28.
However, she said that the recent Critical Minerals Section 232 decision suggests that the Trump Administration is no longer solely relying on tariffs to enhance the US security of supply in metals. “This means that if tariff threats fade and trade routes normalise, excess inventories could quickly hit the market, causing speculative trades to unwind. In such an instance, copper prices could fall just as fast as they have risen,” she warned.

livemint,markets,Why is Indian stock market not witnessing a sharp rally despite India-EU free trade agreement? Explained,"Despite the promising India-EU free trade agreement, the Indian stock market is not experiencing a strong rally. Experts cite mixed earnings, FII selling, and geopolitical uncertainties as key factors dampening sentiment.&amp;nbsp;",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/why-is-indian-stock-market-sensex-nifty-not-witnessing-a-sharp-rally-despite-india-eu-free-trade-agreement-explained-11769575753606.html,2026-01-28,"Equity benchmark Sensex jumped over 600 points, or nearly 0.80%, in morning deals on Wednesday but soon pared most of its gains to drift to an intraday low of 81,887.93, just 30 points above its previous close of 81,857.48. Similarly, the NSE counterpart, the Nifty 50, also rose by 0.80% in the morning session but soon slipped to an intraday low of 25,225.70, just 0.20% above its previous close of 25,175.40.
While the India-EU free trade agreement has underpinned market sentiment, it has not sparked aggressive buying in the domestic market.
“The deal is positive for India. Indian exports will get very competitive. However, it will take months for the deal to go live. Much will depend on execution,"" P. Krishnan, MD and CIO, Spark Asset Management, noted.
""This deal got expedited as both sides wanted some risk mitigation to counter the chaos being churned out by the US. As for markets, this lifts sentiments. This is not a game changer for the market nor does it lead to earnings upgrades on its own,” Krishnan said.
One of the biggest reasons is that the market had already discounted this deal to a large extent, given the signals from Davos following US President Donald Trump's aggression against European countries over Greenland.
The India-EU FTA (free trade agreement) is a long-term positive for India's trade and economy, but not an immediate trigger for the market, which is facing he heat of relentless FII selling, unimpressive earnings, and geopolitical uncertainties.
""The India-EU trade deal is a huge positive, but it was largely discounted by the markets. Markets respond only when something unexpected happens. This was already expected. That is why it has not boosted market sentiment as expected by many,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments.
The India-EU FTA does not have an immediate, direct impact on the major factors, such as FII selling, US tariffs, weak earnings, and currency fluctuations, behind the domestic market's weakness over the last several months.
Market participants also acknowledge that the India-EU FTA cannot offset the impact of an India-US trade deal.
""Of course, India-EU FTA is a big deal, but then it is important to understand that this is not a substitute for the India-US trade deal. The US remains India’s largest single-country export market and its biggest bilateral trade surplus partner. We have a $41 billion trade surplus with the US and only $15 billion surplus with the EU. So, the India-US trade deal is more important,"" Vijayakumar explained.
Pankaj Pandey, the head of research at ICICI Securities, said the market is slowly digesting the India-EU trade deal, while awaiting further details.
""I think we need furthermore details to sort of come out on his India-EU trade deal. So, while yes, it is positive, but the market is looking for some near-term opportunity to sort of come back,"" said Pandey.
The domestic market has not seen much of a run-up to the budget kind of rally this year. The limited gains in the market could be because of some short covering.
""The short positions on F&O are significantly higher. So, ahead of the budget, no one would want to carry such a high short position. Therefore, some bit of short covering is what we are sort of sensing,"" Pandey said.
The market is not carrying any major expectations from the Budget. However, major policy reforms and positive surprises on the taxes front can lift market sentiment.
""From the Budget, there is no major expectation that the market is carrying at this point in time. But a few things can still sort of perk up the market. If something happens on the housing front, especially affordable housing, that can be a positive,"" said Pandey.
""Any taxation relief to FPIs can really sort of change the sentiment. Till the time it does not come, the market is not going to sort of factor in the Budget beforehand,"" said Pandey.
Amid all the global noise and chatter around the Budget, earnings remain the most important factor for the market. Strong earnings growth can bring back FIIs, improving market sentiment significantly.
Q3 results of Indian corporates have been mixed so far. There are some green signals, but they are being eclipsed by concerns that the Indian rupee's weakness and US tariff-led uncertainties could dent the prospects of healthy corporate profitability.

livemint,companies,WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart hits back at Elon Musk over app 'not secure' remark amid Meta privacy lawsuit,"Meta has denied allegations that it reads users' private messages on WhatsApp, with WhatsApp head Will Cathcart calling them 'totally false'. Details here.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/whatsapp-chief-will-cathcart-hits-back-at-elon-musk-over-app-not-secure-remark-amid-meta-privacy-lawsuit-11769590405002.html,2026-01-28,"Meta has pushed back on allegations that it can secretly read users' private messages on WhatsApp, with the messaging platform's head, Will Cathcart, dismissing the claims as ‘totally false’.
Cathcart's remarks were directly aimed at billionaire Elon Musk's claims that WhatsApp is ‘not safe’, and that users should rather switch to X's messaging service as a safer alternative for communication.
“This is totally false. WhatsApp can’t read messages because the encryption keys are stored on your phone and we don’t have access to them,” Cathcart said in an X (formerly Twitter) post.
These sharp remarks from Meta and rival company executives come amid renewed scrutiny of message security on WhatsApp after an international group of plaintiffs sued Meta platforms on Monday. The lawsuit accused the company of making false privacy claims.
The complaint makes serious claims that Meta employees can gain access to any user messages through an internet system, which means they can bypass the encryption that WhatsApp has marketed as its core privacy feature for the past many years.
“This is a no-merit, headline-seeking lawsuit brought by the very same firm defending NSO after their spyware attacked journalists and government officials,” Cathcart wrote on X.
A spokesperson for Meta also responded to the allegations earlier, stating that the lawsuit was “frivolous”, along with announcing that the company “will pursue sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel,”Bloombergreported.
According to WhatsApp, its encrypted chats are enabled by default, with an in-app message stating that “only people in this chat can read, listen to, or share” the messages exchanged between two or more people.
Elon Musk, who owns rival company X, has had a longstanding rivalry with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, which has included business disagreements over data practices, AI and rockets.
The feud was sparked in September 2016 after a collaboration between the two billionaires did not go well, as Zuckerberg’s $200 million satellite exploded during a pre-launch test on one of Musk’s SpaceX rockets.
In his latest tweet on the Meta privacy row, Musk also questioned Signal, which is a privacy-focused app endorsed by whistleblowers like Edward Snowden. Snowden said in a tweet earlier that he can vouch for the Signal app, noting it is secure and that he uses the platform every day.
The lawsuit remains underway, with industry experts, legal analysts, and market watchers closely tracking its progress as they await further updates and clarity on the next stages of the case.

livemint,companies,How to fix Disney: A road map for the next CEO,Barron’s offers a four-step plan for Bob Iger’s successor.,https://www.livemint.com/companies/how-to-fix-disney-a-road-map-for-the-next-ceo-11769595962690.html,2026-01-28,"There has been plenty of drama at Walt Disney over the past decade. Since January 2016, the House of Mouse has released four Star Wars films, built a streaming platform, and overseen the departure and dramatic comeback of CEO Bob Iger.
But it has hardly been a fairy tale for investors. Disney shares were trading at about $110 on Tuesday—just 17% above where they were 10 years ago. Netflix and the S&P 500 are up 832% and 271%, respectively, over the same period.
Still, there’s reason for hope. Barron’s in December named the stock as a top pick for 2026, citing a cheap valuation for a company that controls elite entertainment assets and looks set for strong theme-park earnings growth.
There will also be a new CEO. Iger is set to step down at the end of 2026, with Disney expected to announce his successor within the next few weeks. Parks chief Josh D’Amaro and TV head Dana Walden are the leading candidates, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Disney didn’t respond to a request for comment about its CEO succession plans.
Whoever gets the gig faces a huge task in turning around a lost decade for the shares. Barron’s has drawn up a to-do list for Iger’s replacement.

Disney’s most worrying asset over the past decade has been ESPN. The cable sports network has gone from major moneymaker to pain point, bleeding subscribers as the pivot to streaming has accelerated.
Disney can’t turn back the tide, but there are ways to stop the rot. The company finally launched an ESPN streaming service in August, and the key question now is whether that can deliver enough profit to offset cable losses.
Disney is close to doing just that. Operating income for the sports segment climbed by $476 million last year, while profit for the linear networks division fell by $497 million. Iger said in November that the ESPN streaming launch had been “a real success,"" but investors will likely remain skeptical until February, when Disney will report earnings for its fiscal first quarter.
The big date on the horizon is February 2027, when ESPN is set to air the Super Bowl for the first time. Over the longer term, the new CEO has plenty of options—including selling off or spinning out ESPN, emulating Comcast’s move to jettison its cable assets.
4) Build on Parks SuccessThis one is simple. The experiences division, which includes theme parks and cruise lines, has become Disney’s biggest earnings driver.

livemint,companies,4700BC popcorn adds a dash of indulgence to Marico’s food portfolio,"Marico’s acquisition of premium popcorn brand 4700BC is aimed at adding indulgent snacking to its largely health-led foods portfolio, as the company targets 25% CAGR growth in the segment.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/4700bc-popcorn-marico-food-portfolio-gourmet-snacks-11769577753185.html,2026-01-28,"MUMBAI: 
     
      India’s snacking habits are moving from cinema halls to living rooms, and Marico wants a front-row seat.
As the FMCG major eyes a 25% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in its foods portfolio, its acquisition of premium popcorn brand 4700BC is designed to capture at-home indulgence without abandoning its health-led roots.
“One of our key learnings is that while consumers are willing to spend on healthier options, they are not willing to compromise on taste,"" Saugata Gupta, MD and CEO of Marico toldMint. “That’s where 4700BC becomes a great fit in our foods portfolio.""
Founded in 2012 as a premium packaged popcorn brand, 4700BC was acquired by multiplex operator PVR in 2015, which bought a 70% stake for₹5 crore. Marico this week acquired just over 93% of the brand for₹226.83 crore.
Marico’s foods portfolio grew 5% year-on-year in the December 2025 quarter, as some products were rationalized and Saffola edible oils saw a decline in volumes, remaining flat in value terms, the company said in its earnings release.
The company, however, reiterated that it is on track to grow the foods portfolio to eight times its FY20 size. In the December quarter, Marico reported 8% growth in volumes and 27% growth in consolidated revenue to₹3,537 crore, while profit after tax rose 12% year-on-year to₹447 crore.
Marico’s foods portfolio is largely anchored around health and wellness brands. These include Saffola, which sells oats, honey and soya chunks, and True Elements, a premium brand in which Marico first acquired a stake in 2022. It also owns Plix, acquired in 2023, which sells supplements such as apple cider vinegar.
“Plix strengthens our presence in nutraceuticals and also gives us a foothold in personal care,"" Gupta said. “Saffola and True Elements remain strong in wellness, but not in indulgence. And this was the gap we aimed to fill.""
He added that Marico wanted to participate in the emerging “gourmet but better-for-you"" space. “Our digital playbook focuses on building adjacencies where we have a right to win, and filling these spaces. With 4700 BC, we now have a place in the premium gourmet snacking category.""
Tata Consumer Products has also aggressively scaled via healthier brands like Soulfull and pan-Asian snacks under Ching’s Secret (Capital Foods). In contrast, HUL does not have a savoury snack play; it sells soups and packaged noodles under the Knorr brand, and has been selling ice-creams under Kwality Walls. It demerged this business in December last year.
In recent years, 4700BC has expanded its portfolio to include premium snacks such asmakhanaand nachos made in avocado oil. It has also tapped new sales channels, including business class offerings on airlines such as Etihad and Qatar Airways.
However, Gupta said most of the brand’s sales now come from online platforms, with only a small portion coming from PVR-Inox cinemas.
Marico will continue the brand’s sales arrangement in over 50 PVR-Inox theatres, Gupta added, while also expanding distribution through modern trade and general trade using Marico’s existing network.

According to the agency report citing the aircraft manufacturer, narrow-body aircraft will account for nearly 90% of the projected deliveries at 2,875, while wide-body aircraft will be at 395.
Boeing's Managing Director of Commercial Marketing, Eurasia and Indian Subcontinent, Ashwin Naidu, said that India is a growth market and the country will add more planes.
The report also mentioned that the demand for air travel means airlines will need nearly 3,300 new aeroplanes by 2044.
“Accounting for growth and replacement, the Indian and South Asian region's fleet will grow from 795 to 2,925 airplanes in two decades, a nearly fourfold increase over that time,” the report mentioned.
As per the CMO, Indian and South Asian airlines are also expected to expand and diversify their long-haul networks as India grows as a key hub for international passenger and cargo traffic.
“The South Asia region's widebody fleet will more than triple by 2044 as carriers enable millions of Indian and South Asian passengers to travel to international markets including the Middle East, Europe and North America,” said Boeing in its report cited by the news agency.
The report also mentioned that the air cargo market will be boosted by high-tech manufacturing growth in India and the increasing role of e-commerce, as they increase the need for more freighter aeroplanes.
“The South Asia region's fleet of new and converted freighters is expected to grow five times its current size over the next two decades to support rising air cargo demand,” Boeing said.

livemint,companies,Adani Power Q3 preview: Bangladesh deal may weigh on earnings,Investors will closely watch Adani Power’s Q3 results amid uncertainty over its Bangladesh power deal.,https://www.livemint.com/companies/adani-power-q3-earnings-bangladesh-deal-impact-investor-outlook-11769583686492.html,2026-01-28,"MUMBAI: 
     
      Adani Power Ltd’s contrarian bet on coal-fired power plants—at a time when most private-sector peers shunned the dirty fuel amid environmental scrutiny—has ensured the firm will have a clear growth path over the coming decade, according to experts.
However, skittish investors who are paying a premium for this growth story, may see a short-term hurdle over uncertainty around the company’s lucrative power supply deal to Bangladesh.
As the company declares its earnings on Thursday, revenues are expected to grow marginally to₹13,848 crore, up from₹13,434 crore in the year-ago quarter, according to the consensus estimate of three analysts polled byBloomberg. Profit is expected to grow by 5% to₹3,075 crore, the analysts estimated.
The muted earnings growth estimate has been attributed to a similar growth in demand for thermal power during this period.
Here are the top things investors should look out for at the company’s Q3FY26 earnings:
Adani Power’s 1,600-megawatt ultra super-critical plant at Godda in Jharkhand supplies power exclusively to the Bangladesh grid. The transaction, which brings rich margins for the company, has come under scrutiny after an influential national review committee (NRC) in Bangladesh analyzed the country’s severely haemorrhaging power sector.
The NRC has concluded that the national power distributor was buying more electricity than the country needed, and that it was doing so at a high price from private players, especially Adani Power. It recommended renegotiations of these deals, which puts in jeopardy Adani’s 2017 deal with the now-ousted Sheikh Hasina government.
The company makes over₹8,300 crore a year in revenue and over₹4,800 crore in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) from the deal, as disclosed by its management in an analyst call on 1 May 2025. This translates to over 14% of the company’s FY25 revenue and nearly a fifth of its Ebitda that fiscal year, making the deal vital for the company.
“Cash flows from the 1.6-gigawatt Godda plant in Bangladesh remain exposed to payment delays, power purchase agreement (PPA) renegotiation risk, and legal uncertainty following scrutiny by the Bangladesh high court, despite recent clearance of past dues,"" analysts at brokerage JM Financial noted in a report on 2 January.
But the company has one trick up its sleeve—an imminent connection to the Indian grid. In the event the contract with the Bangladesh government falls through, the company has a backup plan to sell the power in India. However, it is not an ideal scenario, as power will sell at a much lower price in the spot market in India, as demonstrated above. Moreover, there are significant pending dues from the Bangladesh Power Development Board, which could further affect the company’s cash flows.
Adani Power is the most rapidly growing coal-based independent power producer in the country. It plans to ramp up its capacity from 18.2GW at present to 41.9GW by 2032. This will make it the largest thermal power producer in the country.
With the increasing share of variable-renewable power in India’s grid, the government is working to rapidly expand steady thermal power capacity to handle base loads. The country has charted the need for 80GW additional thermal power capacity by FY32, of which, Adani Power has already locked in 23.7GW, giving it a significant growth potential.
“Adani Power was the first one to see the indispensability of thermal power in India’s growth story, while many industry peers were scaling back on thermal due to the global shift toward renewables,"" the JM Financial analysts noted.
The company gradually built capacities and became the country's largest private-sector thermal power producer with over 18GW capacity through organic growth (10.8GW) and a string of acquisitions of stressed assets (7.3 GW).
Investors would keenly track updates and management outlook on this. “Adani Power is undertaking aggressive capacity expansion, exposing it to risks of time and cost overruns, funding pressure, and execution slippages, despite its strong track record and land availability,"" wrote the JM Financial analysts.

livemint,companies,Fleet constraints slow Air India Express’s Navi Mumbai expansion,"While IndiGo and Akasa have rolled out most of the routes they announced last year, Air India Express hasn't been able to achieve its goal. In September, it had said it would operate 20 daily departures, connecting 15 Indian cities in the initial phase of the new airport’s operations.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/air-india-express-navi-mumbai-flights-expansion-11769577937966.html,2026-01-28,"Hyderabad: Faced with fleet constraints, budget carrier Air India Express expects to expand connectivity from the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) to 15 other cities by the end of 2026, a target it had aimed to achieve in the early phase of the new airport's operations.
According to data compiled by Curium, the Tata Group-owned Air India Express currently connects Bengaluru and Delhi to Navi Mumbai International Airport, which began commercial operations on 25 December last year.
IndiGo operates flights from India's newest airport to 13 cities, while Akasa Air flies to four, according to data from Curium.
While IndiGo and Akasa have rolled out most of the routes they announced last year, Air India Express hasn't been able to achieve its stated goal. In September, it had said it would operate 20 daily departures or 40 air traffic movements from and to NMIA, connecting 15 Indian cities in the initial phase of the new airport’s operations. The airline had also said it intended to scale up to 55 daily departures by mid-2026, including up to 5 daily international flights from NMIA.
Singh cited fleet constraints that have limited the carrier’s planned connectivity expansion.
Air India Express’s fleet size is about 110. In November, Singh said that the airline would add 20-24 planes in 2026, which would translate to about 2 planes per month.
Singh, however, clarified that Air India Express’s fleet size at the end of 2026 would remain almost unchanged.
“However, fleet size will remain the same. Because there will be returns,"" Singh said.
Air India Express is refreshing its fleet with new aircraft, increasing the share of modern planes that deliver superior, more consistent customer experience. As part of this transition, aircraft at the end of their lease terms will be phased out, keeping the overall fleet size unchanged, a company spokesperson toldMint.
The previous induction of 51 aircraft was mostly white tails, which are fully constructed airplanes produced by manufacturers (like Boeing or Airbus) that do not have an immediate, contracted customer. These planes are frequently created when orders are cancelled, during production overruns
On 1 October 2024, Air India Express completed its merger with AIX Connect, previously known as AirAsia India. The Tata Group now operates two airline brands: Air India and the low-cost carrier Air India Express.

The Mumbai-based company, which has campuses in Navi Mumbai, Noida and GIFT City, had secured approvals to list its US parent entity following a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).
The company will now prioritize an India initial public offering (IPO) amid rising domestic investor appetite for digital infrastructure and AI-linked assets, said Sunil Gupta, chief executive officer of Yotta. He said Yotta retains the option to raise capital overseas later.
“Our current plan is to raise capital in India first. The structure allows us to keep the US option open, it’s a question of sequencing,"" Gupta said in an interview withMint. “If everything goes well, next financial year is when we could be coming to the market in India.""
“Indian investors are already factoring India risk when they invest. For overseas investors, India is still an external risk,"" he said. “Given the response we are seeing in India from family offices, high-net-worth individuals and funds, we believe we may be able to raise sufficient equity domestically to fund our near-term GPU, cloud and data centre expansion.""
Yotta’s parent company, Nidar Infrastructure, said it planned to list on the Nasdaq through a merger with Cartica Acquisition Corp, valuing the business at $2.75 billion pre-transaction, according to regulatory filings. The combined entity was expected to list under the tickers YTTA and YTTAW.
However, Nidar Infrastructure said in a 7 January filing that it had elected not to proceed with the business combination outlined in the Form F-4 registration statement. Gupta said the SPAC transaction is now off the table and that any future US listing would require a fresh process.
Gupta said an India-first listing would allow Yotta to build scale and valuation before tapping the overseas markets.
“Once we are listed in India, we can approach overseas markets with much higher strength,"" he said.
“India’s capital market investors are showing strong appetite for AI-adjacent public listings, particularly across AI software, data centres, cloud services and application-layer technology,"" said Shivam Bajaj, founder and chief executive officer of Avener Capital.
The current listed universe offers limited pure-play AI exposure, leaving investors with few direct avenues to participate in the theme, Bajaj said.
“For AI builders, a key question will be how public market investors ultimately value the business, whether as a data centre-led infrastructure platform with stable cash flows or as a strategic AI company with technology-driven upside,"" he added, pointing to a healthy pipeline of upcoming data centre IPOs.
Sify Infinit Spaces Ltd has received the market regulator’s approval for a₹3,700 crore IPO, while Hyderabad-based CtrlS Datacenters is exploring a public listing to fund its expansion to over 1 gigawatt of capacity within four years.
Gupta called for a sharp increase in government funding for the IndiaAI Mission in the upcoming FY27 budget.
Yotta’s revenue more than doubled to an estimated $49.2 million in FY24 from $22 million in FY23, while its net loss narrowed marginally to $52.8 million. The company has projected revenue of $156 million in FY25, alongside a deeper net loss of $113.4 million as it accelerates capital expenditure.
According to Mordor Intelligence, India’s data centre and AI infrastructure market is expected to grow from about $11.76 billion in early 2026 to $25.07 billion by 2031, driven by cloud adoption, data localization requirements and AI workloads.
At its flagship Panvel campus near Navi Mumbai, Yotta has expanded its land bank from an initial 20 acres to about 70 acres, enabling the development of up to 22 data centre buildings, Gupta said. He declined to disclose a completion timeline, saying construction will be driven by customer contracts and demand visibility.
“We won’t build blindly. The pace depends entirely on the deals we win,"" he said.
Once fully built, the Panvel campus alone will have power feasibility of up to 2 GW, supported by land, fibre and grid connectivity.
“Without AI, we were projecting around 3 GW by 2028-2030 overall. With AI demand, India could reach 6 to 7 GW in the same period.""
Yotta’s revenue mix has shifted sharply toward higher layers of the stack. Co-location now contributes about 20% of revenue, sovereign cloud and managed services account for roughly 30%, while GPU and AI services make up 40-50%.
To be sure, the economics vary significantly across layers. Building a traditional co-location facility typically requires $5-6 million per megawatt of IT load. Fully GPU-based AI infrastructure can require investments of up to $40 million per megawatt.
Despite strong demand, access to risk capital remains the biggest constraint for India’s AI infrastructure ecosystem, he added.

Fulcrum aims to enhance efficiency and accuracy, allowing brokers to focus on high-value tasks.&amp;nbsp;",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/insurtech-startup-fulcrum-raises-25-million-in-seed-series-a-funding-11769581895769.html,2026-01-28,"Fulcrum, the leading AI platform for insurance brokerages, on Wednesday, January 28, announced $25 million in combined seed and series A funding.
The company said the funding was led by CRV, with participation from several prominent insurance and tech angel investors, including South Park Commons and Foundation Capital.
The company, in a media release on Wednesday, said that it is helping insurance brokerages “modernise their day-to-day workflows with AI agents that handle coverage and claim analysis, proposal generation, client and carrier sales prep, policy checking, and certificate issuance.”
So far, critical servicing tasks in the sector have been handled by business process outsourcing (BPO) partners, which often require each policy to undergo multiple handoffs among BPO teams.
Fulcrum, co-founded by CEO Arjun Mangla and CTO Sambhav Anand, is attempting to address this issue.
According to the company, its AI agents handle everything from “coverage and claim analysis, proposal generation, policy checking, client and carrier sales prep, and certificate issuance — enabling brokerages to deliver faster, more accurate service without adding headcount or relying on costly BPO providers.”
“For too long, insurance brokerages have accepted a complex and outdated web of partners, paperwork, and legacy systems. We’re showing that it doesn’t have to be this way. Fulcrum is re-architecting the brokerage back office with AI that’s fast, precise, and deeply integrated into how teams actually work,"" said Arjun Mangla, Co-founder and CEO of Fulcrum.
Fulcrum claimed its customer base already includes nearly half of the top 50 U.S. insurance brokerages, reflecting rapid adoption among large, data-heavy firms that previously depended on offshore BPOs for policy checking and quality assurance.
“The amount of variation, minutiae, and data that brokerages deal with is enormous. Even the best heuristic software couldn’t manage this level of complexity at scale. With recent developments in AI, that’s finally changed. We’re able to rethink how the manual, repetitive parts of the job get done so brokers can focus on the high-value work they actually enjoy,"" said Sambhav Anand, Co-founder and CTO of Fulcrum.

Meanwhile, Musk once again claimed that Khosla had tried to stop the public from using a public beach near his house, an allegation he has also made in the past. The billionaire appears to be referring to Khosla’s multiple lawsuits over restricting public access to Martins Beach near his estate.
The two billionaires have a history of clashing on social media over various issues. During the 2024 US elections, Musk had urged Khosla to support Donald Trump. In response, Khosla said it was hard for him to support someone “with no values, lies, cheats, rapes, demeans women, hates immigrants like me.”
Khosla, who is among the first institutional backers of OpenAI, has also defended the ChatGPT maker against Musk’s lawsuits, stating that Musk suing OpenAI feels like “sour grapes.” Khosla added that Musk did not get in early enough in the AI race and did not stay committed, which is why he is now resorting to litigation.

livemint,companies,"Four years under Tata, Air India still in recovery mode. How does it stack up against IndiGo?","Air India has made progress towards a turnaround in the Tata Group fold. But it’s far from a breakout, and catastrophic setbacks have not helped.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/air-india-vs-indigo-air-india-express-tata-group-aviation-industry-india-11769512763547.html,2026-01-28,"On 27 January 2022, the government sold its beleaguered airline Air India to the Tata Group. Four years later, the airline is in better shape, on a path of consolidation, growth, and repair. Yet the pace of that turnaround, amid generally favourable industry conditions, has fallen short of management’s expectations. A key setback was the crash of an Air India international flight in Ahmedabad in June 2025.
But even without that tragedy, data shows that Air India and its low-cost subsidiary, Air India Express, have grown more slowly than their main rival, IndiGo, and are far from challenging its dominance.
India’s domestic aviation market has steadily expanded. The year the Tatas acquired Air India was still a recovery period after covid-related shutdowns, but 2023 saw about 152 million passengers on domestic flights, rising to roughly 161 million in 2024. Estimates for 2025 suggest 165-170 million passengers.
Air India Express has steadily gained, crossing a 10% passenger share for the first time in 2025. Air India’s domestic share, however, slipped after cutting frequencies on select routes following the June crash. IndiGo, meanwhile, faced operational challenges due to pilot shortages under new regulations.
A clearer long-term view comes from comparing market share between 2022 and 2024. Over this period, the Air India duo gained 4.2 percentage points, while market leader IndiGo added 5.9 points, on a larger base.
The international segment has seen similar trends. Passenger numbers rose from 28.4 million in 2023 to 32.7 million in 2024, with 2025 expected to reach around 36 million. Indian carriers’ combined market share now stands at roughly 46%.
In 2025, following its plane crash, Air India cut back capacity on some long-haul routes, resulting in a marked drop in its 2025 share. Here too, a truer comparison is between 2022 and 2024, where the Air India duo gained 1.2 percentage points in passenger share, while IndiGo gained 2 percentage points.
Distance is another variable in the international segment. Air India operates more wide-body aircraft, which travel longer distances and have a higher seating capacity. Thus, its share of passenger revenues is higher than its share of passengers. For example, among Indian airlines in 2024, Air India had a 35.9% share of passengers, but a 53.1% share of passenger-kilometre.
The June 2025 plane crash has been a setback for Air India. It is in the midst of a five-year-old, ambitious, and multi-pronged transformation titled Vihaan.ai, which began in September 2022. The significant pieces of this plan include buying new planes, retrofitting old ones, integrating multiple airlines, expanding to new routes, adding more operational staff, and investing more in other building blocks like training and maintenance.
Both Air India and Air India Express need new planes to expand and win passenger share, as well as to improve their fleet specs. At their current average age of 8.6-8.8 years, their fleets are among the oldest among Indian airlines.
Another area where Air India has had to catch up in a significant way is strength of pilots. Between March 2016 and March 2022, this count for Air India dropped from 1,411 to 1,116. For Air India Express, it inched up from 269 to 333.
Between March 2022 and March 2025, Air India’s pilot strength grew threefold and that of Air India Express sixfold. Together, as of March 2025, they were only 51 pilots short of IndiGo. On a per-plane basis, they were doing better than IndiGo, though the requirement for wide-bodied planes, which Air India operates more, is greater.
Pilot strength also gains importance in light of new regulations, which necessitate all airlines to have more pilots than they currently have.
But profitability remains elusive. In 2024-25, the two airlines reported a combined net loss of about₹9,700 crore. Setbacks like the crash don’t help the business, from both a reputational and financial standpoint.
Last week, Bloomberg reported the airline was looking at a net loss of about₹15,000 crore for 2025-26. Compare this with IndiGo, which reported a similar net profit in 2023-24 and 2024-25.
For airlines, the main cost is fuel, and crude oil prices have been favourable. Air India has capitalised on this window, but not to the extent it initially charted out.

livemint,companies,China's BYD considers local assembly in India as dealers sit on hundreds of orders,"BYD Co. is considering local assembly in India to meet rising demand for its electric vehicles and is seeking regulatory certifications. This follows previous rejections for a full assembly plant, reflecting a strategic shift as the company aims to expand amid growing sales in the Indian market.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/byd-could-expand-india-operations-as-demand-begins-to-outstrip-supply-11769569908465.html,2026-01-28,"BYD Co. is weighing options to expand in India, including local assembly to meet surging demand for the Chinese automaker’s electric vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter.
The company is evaluating some form of local assembly in India and working on obtaining local safety and regulatory certifications for more models because of import quotas, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plans have not been publicly disclosed.
The discussions highlight both the opportunity and the regulatory hurdles BYD faces in one of the world’s fastest-growing auto markets. They also reflect a strategic shift for the Chinese carmaker, which is now doubling down in India, despite New Delhi’s pushback in the past to its investment proposal during a period of heightened scrutiny of Chinese firms. Ties between India and China have somewhat thawed since last year as both nations faced steep tariffs levied by the US.
A spokesperson for BYD did not respond to an email seeking comment on its India plans.
Diversifying beyond China has become increasingly important for BYD as growth slows at home amid reduced EV subsidies and intensifying competition. It’s aiming to increase deliveries to markets outside China by nearly 25% this year.
BYD’s India sales jumped about 88% last year to roughly 5,500 cars, straining its ability to operate under rules that cap imports of each fully built model at 2,500 units. That growth came despite import duties of up to 110% on fully built cars, driven by a price tag that’s relatively lower than Tesla’s. Using SKD assembly would slash tariffs to 30% from 70%.
The company sells the Atto 3 compact e-SUV and the eMax7 multipurpose vehicle in India — both approved for imports beyond the 2,500-car quota — along with the Sealion 7 and the Seal sedan.
The automaker has approached Indian auto sector regulators to flag how import limits could constrain growth. Most inventory in the December quarter has been sold out, the people said, unlike Tesla, which continues to struggle against the same tariff barriers.
Despite a tentative thaw between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that led to the resumption of direct flights, policy support remains inconsistent.
Some BYD executives, including engineers and senior managers, have been visiting India since last year. But senior BYD executives who had planned visits last year have since delayed their travel, the people said, without giving more details.

The Japanese conglomerate, which is already one of the largest backers of the ChatGPT-maker, is adding to its stake in the company, people familiar with the matter told WSJ.
According to a separate report by Reuters quoting people with knowledge of the development, SoftBank is in deliberations to commit more capital toward the fast-growing startup.
The maximum amount SoftBank is considering is $30 billion, Reuters and WSJ reported quoting people familiar with the matter.
As per Reuters, the people cautioned that the discussions are fluid and the amount of funding could change. SoftBank’s shares rose 5.8% in Tokyo Wednesday.
According to that report, the investment round could value the company to as much as $830 billion if OpenAI succeeds in raising the funds.
SoftBank sold its stake in Nvidia Corp. and recently hit pause on talks to buy out US data centre operator Switch Inc.
The Tokyo-based company had amassed an 11% stake in OpenAI, injecting $22.5 billion just last month.
SoftBank has sharply increased its bets in AI in recent months. Over the past year, the Tokyo-based company has bought US chip designer Ampere Computing LLC for $6.5 billion and announced a $5.4 billion acquisition of ABB Ltd.’s robotics unit. To finance some of that cost, SoftBank has sold down its T-Mobile US Inc. shares, unloaded its entire Nvidia stake and expanded a margin loan using its Arm shares.
SoftBank’s investments in AI, along with the sharp drop in the value of Arm shares at the end of last year, are heaping pressure on its creditworthiness, S&P Global Ratings warned earlier this month.
Despite being early to invest in AI technologies, SoftBank has largely missed out on a global rush to build the semiconductors, server racks and other hardware to support machine learning.

livemint,companies,Amazon layoffs: Tech giant mistakenly confirms sacking of cloud unit employees in email,"Employees in Amazon's cloud division, AWS, received a notice on Tuesday acknowledging “organizational changes” at the tech giant.&amp;nbsp;",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/amazon-layoffs-tech-giant-mistakenly-confirms-sacking-of-cloud-unit-employees-in-email-11769566248625.html,2026-01-28,"Amazon Layoffs:Tech giant Amazon on Tuesday mistakenly sent a notice to some employees, confirming a wave of upcoming layoffs at the company.
“Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of applied AI solutions at AWS, wrote in the email, seen byCNBC.
“These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,"" it added.
The email also mentions a post from Amazon’s HR boss Beth Galetti, saying that the company had already notified “impacted colleagues in our organization,” in the US, Canada and Costa Rica that they had lost their jobs.
According toReuters, AWS employees who received the email said in their Slack messages that the meeting called for Wednesday was almost immediately cancelled.
“These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,” the email further read, as perReuters.
However, the Andy Jassy-led company has not yet informed impacted workers, nor has it confirmed the news.
Jobs in the company's units covering AWS, retail, Prime Video and human resources were slated to be affected,Reutersreported, quoting people familiar with the matter.
Amazon laid off about 14,000 people in October as part of a broader plan to reduce corporate staff by around 30,000, people familiar with the matter said at the time.
On Tuesday, Amazon cut jobs in its Fresh grocery and Go market divisions as it plans to close existing brick-and-mortar stores and convert some of them to Whole Foods stores. It did not disclose the number of affected employees.
The size of the cuts to be announced on Wednesday remained unclear. The full 30,000 jobs flagged in October would represent a small portion of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of the company's corporate workforce.
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs were meant to reduce management layers and bureaucracy inside the company.

livemint,companies,Amazon turns over a new leaf in physical stores. It’s about grocery delivery.,Amazon.com is closing dozens of Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh physical stores to focus on expanding same-day delivery of groceries and adding to its Whole Foods operations.,https://www.livemint.com/companies/amazon-turns-over-a-new-leaf-in-physical-stores-it-s-about-grocery-delivery-11769565701287.html,2026-01-28,"Amazon.com is closing dozens of Amazon Fresh physical stores and automated Amazon Go outlets to focus on expanding its same-day grocery deliveries to more locations and adding to its Whole Foods Market operations.
The e-commerce retailer admitted in a blog post on Tuesday that although it has seen “encouraging signals"" in its Amazon-branded physical grocery stores and “gathered valuable insights"" about customer preferences, “we haven’t yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion.""
Amazon will convert some of the locations to Whole Foods stores, as part of plans to open 100 or more Whole Foods Market locations in the next few years.
Amazon’s stock was up 2% to around $243 in early afternoon trading, while the S&P 500 was up 0.5%. The stock is up about 5.5% this year and up 2.2% over the past 12 months.
Walmart’s stock was down 0.5% in afternoon trading, while Instacart was down nearly 6%.
Amazon has battled for grocery sales market share with Walmart, which has 4,000 stores. Amazon calls itself one of the top three grocers in the U.S., with more than $150 billion in gross sales and more than 150 million customers shopping for groceries each year.
Mizuho analysts led by David Bellinger said developing a larger fulfillment network could help Amazon push its market share into the mid-single digit range over the next two to three years from an estimated 3% in the category now. But the analysts also note that for the 12 months ended in June 2025, grocery rival Kroger had about 8.5% market share of grocery spending, Costco had about 8.4%, and Publix had 4.1%.
Mizuho sees a limited impact from Amazon’s move on Costco, which caters to a different kind of shopper who buys in bulk. Costco’s warehouse format is less dependent on online grocery purchases, the analysts said.
For Amazon to truly go up against Walmart’s 20% share, “we see something larger and more disruptive as necessary,"" the analysts said in a research note.
Some of its strategy shift is already in motion. Amazon is testing new retail formats, including a supercenter concept in suburban Chicago that will offer groceries, household products, and general merchandise, an idea that Mizuho said was very much focused at Walmart.
Amazon operated about 60 Amazon Fresh stores and about 15 Amazon Go locations, Mizuho said.
The renewed focus on online-driven delivery “is a heavy lift and massive structural limitation vs. the 4,000+ Walmart store locations,"" Mizuho said.
Amazon said shoppers will still be able to buy produce, dairy, meat, baked goods, and frozen foods along with millions of everyday household items, electronics, and other Amazon.com products, “all delivered within hours."" It said sales of perishable groceries through its same-day delivery operation have grown 40-times since January 2025, and that fresh groceries now make up nine of the top 10 most-ordered items in markets where perishables are available for same-day delivery.
Five of the new Whole Foods locations will be smaller-format Whole Foods Market Daily Shops, with prepared meals, coffee, and everyday items. Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017 and has expanded it to more than 550 locations.
Amazon said the “Just Walk Out"" technology it developed at its Amazon Go locations, allowing them to center on an automated grab-and-go format, has been “transformative."" It operates the technology in 360 third-party locations including hospitals and sports arenas.
It is expanding that technology internally to breakrooms at more than 40 Amazon fulfillment centers in North America, “helping employees maximize break time,"" with more planned for this year.

economic_times,markets,Jefferies picks 10 stocks that could benefit from possible Budget 2026 announcements. Do you own any?,"Jefferies anticipates the upcoming Union Budget will prioritize defense-led capital expenditure and selective consumption support, with fiscal deficit targets around 4.2% of GDP. The brokerage highlights potential beneficiaries across renewables, real estate, hospitality, and defense sectors, expecting significant growth in defense capex.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/jefferies-picks-10-stocks-that-could-benefit-from-possible-budget-2026-announcements-do-you-own-any/slideshow/127675120.cms,2026-01-28,"Budget expectations from the upcoming FY27 Union Budget remain “low”, with Jefferies noting that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is likely to adhere to the fiscal consolidation roadmap while focusing on defence-led capital expenditure and selective measures to support consumption. The brokerage expects the Centre to set the FY27 fiscal deficit at around 4.2% of GDP, which would imply a slower pace of consolidation of roughly 15–20 basis points annually over FY27–FY31. Alternatively, Jefferies said the government could choose to keep the deficit closer to 4.4% of GDP, signalling a push to support near-term growth. Such a stance would be positive for growth and equities but could lead to firmer bond yields. Here are few stocks that could benefit from the upcoming Budget.
Spending under the PM-KUSUM scheme for solar-powered agricultural pumps could rise sharply from about Rs 2,600 crore in FY26 to nearly Rs 10,000 crore in FY27, which would be positive for cell-backed solar players such as Emmvee Photovoltaic, Premier Energies and Waaree Renewables. Meanwhile, allocations for the PM Suryaghar rooftop solar programme are expected to remain steady at around Rs 20,000 crore in FY27, broadly flat on a year-on-year basis.
Potential policy support in the form of lower taxes for Global Capability Centres (GCCs) and data centres being set up in India could be a positive for office REITs such as Mindspace and Embassy, data centre developers like Lodha, and real estate developers with significant exposure to GCC office space, including WeWork India, DLF and Prestige. Separately, a possible relaxation in the definition of “affordable housing” to include higher-ticket homes in Tier-I cities under the interest subsidy (CLSS) scheme could benefit affordable housing lenders such as Home First, as well as select developers including Lodha and Sunteck.
An increase in budgetary allocation to support medical tourism and promote lesser-known destinations, along with higher investment in tourism infrastructure to cater to mega hospitality events, is expected to benefit hotel and travel stocks broadly. Recognition of hotels as infrastructure and an expansion of schemes such as UDAN for aviation could further support the sector. In addition, announcements related to new airport privatisation are likely to benefit players such as GMR and Adani Enterprises.
On expenditure, Jefferies expects overall government capital spending to grow about 12% in FY27 to ₹12.5 trillion, but stresses that “the requirement of a reset in defence capex will take priority which may grow at a much higher 25%.” With year‑to‑date FY26 defence capex already up 57%, the brokerage sees non‑defence capex growth moderating to the 5–10% range, even as welfare spending edges higher. This will, it says, bodes well for PSU Defence companies.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
