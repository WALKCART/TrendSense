However, sentiment may improve following several key developments over the weekend.
As of FY25, the EU accounts for 17.3% of India’s total exports and 8.4% of imports, noted Madhavi Arora, Lead – Economist at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. She estimates that a possible bilateral alignment could lift India’s exports to the EU by $50 billion by 2031, led by medium-tech manufacturing.
“Improved import efficiency and higher FDIs would further support productivity gains and tech transfers, while greater regulatory certainty could aid IT services exports, where the EU already accounts for ~1/3rd of demand,” Arora said.
Arora sees India-US trade deal as a structural recalibration of exports rather than an ‘event’ to play any positive turnaround for equities. While the India-EU deal could be taken well by the markets, she believes a fruitful US-India deal, stability in the rupee, and reduced global noise remain crucial.
“Sector-wise, textiles, and select Pharma and Chemicals are the major beneficiaries,” Arora said.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday said it will inject over₹2 lakh crore of liquidity into the system through a slew of avenues. The measures include a 90-day Variable Rate Repo (VRR) operation for an amount of₹25,000 crore to be conducted on January 30, 2026 and a USD/INR buy-sell swap auction of $10 billion or₹91,000 crore for a tenor of 3 years to be held on February 4, 2026.
Nifty 50 plunged 2.51% last week amid heavy selling pressure across all sectors, weakening the overall market structure. On the technical front, the benchmark index decisively slipped below its key 200-day EMA and closed below it, signaling a negative trend.
On the upside, he sees resistance at 25,250, while sustained strength above this could lead to a recovery toward 25,500. “Until then, a sell-on-rise strategy remains preferable,” he said.

Experts believe that what started as a convenience has evolved into a standard expectation in various daily scenarios—from local shops and transportation to healthcare and education sectors.
This surge has been propelled by UPI's cost-effective and interoperable framework, a rise in smartphone usage, access to affordable internet, and a regulatory environment that keeps pace with innovation. These factors combined have fostered trust, promoted formalization, and facilitated growth within the digital payments landscape.
Naren Agarwal, CEO, Wealth1, believes targeted Budget measures such as easier access to growth capital, tax incentives for fintech innovation, rationalisation of GST on technology-driven financial services, and continued support for digital public platforms like UPI, Account Aggregator and DigiLocker can significantly boost the sector.
Agarwal added that policy support for AI, data analytics, cybersecurity and regulatory sandboxes will help fintechs scale responsibly, deepen financial inclusion, and reinforce India’s position as a global hub for digital financial services.
Dadheech explained that while zero MDR has played a vital role in accelerating adoption and inclusion, differentiated economics for high-volume use cases can help support continued investment in infrastructure, security, and reliability without affecting smaller merchants. As transaction volumes rise, reinforcing payment resilience, cybersecurity, and fraud prevention will be increasingly important.
Technology—especially AI—is quietly transforming fintech operations, enabling real-time fraud detection, system monitoring, and efficiency at scale. Ultimately, trust in financial services is built on dependable systems backed by human accountability. According to Dadheech, the next phase of fintech growth will be defined not just by reach or speed, but by reliability on the ground and confidence in user support when it matters most.
According to Rohith Reji, Co-Founder & CEO, Neokred, India stands at a tipping point where the “India Stack” could no longer be a mere foundation but a global benchmark.
1. Strengthen the “Embedded Finance” infrastructure - The government has done a phenomenal job with DPI. In 2026, the expectation is to see policies that further democratize banking-as-a-service. Tax incentives for startups building indigenous middleware will ensure that even the smallest non-banking entity can offer sophisticated financial products, decentralizing credit and payments.
2. Bridging the MSME credit gap through account aggregator MSMEs - MSMEs are an absolute essential part of India’s economy, yet credit access gaps persist. What’s needed are mandates that offer subsidies to integrate the Account Aggregator (AA) framework across all financial touchpoints. By making data-backed lending the norm, India can move away from collateral-heavy requirements, allowing fintechs to serve the “missing middle” with precision.
3. Regulatory clarity is crucial - Expansion of regulatory sandboxes with a focus on “green fintech” and AI-driven compliance can smooth the waters greatly. A simplified GST structure for fintech service providers will improve operational efficiency and encourage cross-border collaborations.
4. Incentivize financial literacy and security- As fintechs scale, security is paramount. A dedicated fund for cybersecurity R&D and digital literacy programs will ensure that the “next 500 million” users entering the formal economy do so with confidence and safety.

The Indian stock market is closed for a public holiday on account of Republic Day 2026. Hence, Axis Bank share price will be in focus as the Indian stock market opens on Tuesday.
Axis Bank is expected to report a fall in its December quarter net profit in the range of 1% - 7% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, according to experts. The bank’s Net Interest Income (NII) in Q3FY26 is expected to rise marginally by around 2% YoY.
While net interest margin (NIM) is estimated to drop by around 9 basis points (bps), cost ratios are likely to stay elevated.
Asset quality of the private lender is expected to deteriorate sequentially, and analysts expect seasonal slippages. Loan growth and deposit growth are expected to be healthy.
Axis Bank’s management’s insights regarding asset quality, margin expectations, and forecasts for loan growth, PPoP growth, credit costs, slippages (particularly from the unsecured segment and technical aspects), and the evolution of NIM are important factors to watch.
Axis Bank Q3 results 2026 LIVE: Analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities predict that Axis Bank's net profit will decline in Q3FY23, compared to both the same period last year and the previous quarter. They indicated this is likely due to subdued other income and a decrease in operating profit.
The brokerage forecasts net interest income (NII) to reach₹13,985.8 crore, reflecting a 2.8 percent increase year-on-year and a 1.8 percent rise quarter-on-quarter. Alongside an estimated non-interest income of₹6,330.5 crore (which represents a 6 percent year-on-year growth but a 4.4 percent drop from the previous quarter), they anticipate that Axis Bank's pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) for this quarter will total₹10,246.5 crore.
Axis Bank Q3 results 2026 LIVE: On Friday, Axis Bank share price ended at₹1,260.10 apiece on the BSE. BNP Paribas believes that Axis Bank is set to capture a significant portion of the market in the credit upturn they anticipate in the coming years.
Axis Bank Q3 results 2026 LIVE: The Board of Directors of Axis Bank plans to convene on Monday, January 26, 2026, to review and approve the unaudited financial outcomes for the quarter and the nine months ending December 31, 2026 (Q3FY26/9MFY26).

US gold futures for February delivery gained 2.01% to $5,079.30 per ounce.
The rally in gold prices continued as risk-off sentiment gripped investors amid rising geopolitical risks and trade war fears. Along with this, a weak US dollar also supported sustained buying in the yellow metal.
Over the weekend, US President Donald Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on Canada if it followed through on a trade deal with China. Additionally, he also threatened to hit French wines and champagnes with 200% tariffs in an apparent effort to pressure French President Emmanuel Macron into joining his Board of Peace initiative.
This comes after the military intervention in Venezuela, threats to annexe Greenland and the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine the authority of the US Federal Reserve.
Gold prices last year recorded their best bull run since 1979 as they surged over 75%. So far in 2026, the yellow metal has rallied 17% on a month-to-date basis, driving home the role of gold as a gauge of fear in markets.
Apart from safe-haven demand, a weak US dollar has also made bullion attractive for buyers of other currencies. A gauge of the US currency has fallen almost 2% in six sessions, suggested a Bloomberg report.
Central bank buying, robust ETF inflows and persistent global and economic uncertainty in the face of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, along with the Israel-Iran conflict, have been among other factors that have contributed to gold's persistent sheen over the last year.
Back home, the commodity markets remained shut on account of Republic Day. Trading on MCX will resume on January 27, with the prices expected to shoot up amid catch-up in the international market.
Goldman Sachs, last week, raised its gold price target to $5,400 per ounce for December 2026 from $4,900/oz earlier, noting private-sector and emerging market central banks' diversification into gold.
""We expect further upside (for gold). Our current forecast suggests that prices will peak at around $5,500 later this year,"" Philip Newman, director at Metals Focus, toldReuters.
Sharing a wild target for gold, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki said gold could hit $27,000 in the future. He, however, did not specify the timeline for this target.

The yen reached a high of 153.915 per dollar, marking its strongest position in over three months, following what seemed to be an indication of intervention that caused a spike in Japan's currency on Friday and led to further gains throughout the day.
Investors will remain attentive to Japanese stocks and the yen following a remark from Japan's prime minister, who expressed a willingness to tackle speculative market activities in light of the yen's quick rise on Friday, warning that officials are ready to intervene should volatility increase. An appreciating yen reduces the international earnings for Japan's leading exporters.
Conversely, another element affecting market sentiment was the declaration made on Sunday by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who stated that Canada does not intend to seek a free trade agreement with China, after US President Donald Trump cautioned about implementing 100% tariffs on Canada if it proceeded with a trade deal with China.
On Friday, the main stock indices in the United States closed in a mixed manner, with the Nasdaq Composite continuing its upward momentum as geopolitical tensions eased, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell behind.
The tech-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.28%, ending at 23,501.24, whereas the widely watched Dow decreased by 285.30 points, or 0.58%, closing at 49,098.71. A drop of nearly 4% in Goldman Sachs had a negative effect on the 30-stock index.

This comes amid divergent views on market direction in a truncated week—shortened by the Republic Day holiday on Monday—leading up to the Union budget on 1 February.
While some analysts expect the downtrend from earlier this month to continue, with the Nifty breaking below its crucial 200-day moving average amid persistent foreign portfolio investor selling and a falling rupee, others believe the benchmark is close to bottoming out and could stage a bounce.
Investors will also track moves by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) this week. FPIs sold a provisional₹4,113.38 crore in cash on Friday, per BSE and NSE data. They also raised their cumulative bearish bets on index futures to a record 227,533 contracts, despite the extended weekend.
Friday's selling has taken their cumulative net sales in the current fiscal year through 23 January to₹1.9 trillion, per depository and exchange data. In the previous year (FY25) their secondary share sales stood at a record high of₹2.48 trillion.
Against FPI cash sales of₹1.9 trillion so far this fiscal year (1 April-23 January), DIIs have net purchased cash shares worth₹6.5 trillion.
While this helped the market recover 15% from a 52-week low of 21743.65 on 7 April last year through the 23 January level, it hasn't been enough to sustain the highs.
""Lack of a concrete action on an India-US trade deal, relatively high valuations amid a slowdown in earnings growth and falling rupee have underpinned FPI selling, and there's more to come,"" cautioned Rajesh Palviya, research head at Axis Securities.
Palviya expects Nifty to come under further downside pressure till 24500 initially, despite ""positive "" comments from US treasury secretary Scott Bessent on Friday that the 25% punitive tariff on India could be removed following a steep reduction in Russian oil purchases and RBI's over₹2 trillion liquidity infusion into the financial system between 30 January and 12 February, including a dollar-rupee swap.
However, Rajesh Baheti, director of Crosseas Capital, believes the market had likely formed a bottom and could see a sharp jump following the RBI's liquidity measures, Bessent's comments and a likely India-EU trade deal.
""I think we should form a bottom around current Nifty levels (25,000) and bounce following FPI short covering due to the RBI measures and positive news on tariffs over the weekend,"" Baheti added.
Jyotivardhan Jaipuria, founder of porfolio management services firm Valentis Advisor, believes that Nifty could face more downside until earnings growth picks up amid moderating valuations and the AI trade frenzy.
""Nifty earnings have grown just 6% in the past six quarters through September 2025, while valuations remain sky high at 20 times one year forward earnings. We need to see earnings pick up to around 10-12% which should happen later this year, and a cooling off of the AI trade,"" said Jaipuria.
He added that while India's valuation premium to emerging markets (EM) had fallen from twice the level in September 2024 to around 55% currently, this was largely due to the outperformance of EMs like Korea and Taiwan.
Indeed, global index provider MSCI data shows that MSCI India Index generated a gross return of 4.29% in the year through 31 December 2025, while the MSCI Emerging Markets return had grown 34.36% over the same period.
Independent market analyst Ambareesh Baliga thinks the market could be close to forming a bottom, thanks to positive sentiment over the weekend events, but Rohit Srivastava, founder of IndiaCharts, expects sustained FPI selling to result in further downside through 24,000 levels.
An added cause for concern among investors is the steep fall in the rupee, which hit a new low of 91.97 per US dollar on Friday, down 6.3% over a year, crimping FPI dollar returns.

In the international bullion market, gold rate today surged to a record high above $5,000, while silver price climbed above the $100 mark for the first time.
Spot gold price rose 0.85% to $5,024.95 per ounce, while US gold futures for February delivery gained 0.91% to $5,024.60 per ounce. Spot silver price rose 1.72% to $104.72 per ounce.
Gold prices have soared 64% in 2025, supported by sustained safe-haven demand, US monetary policy easing, robust central bank purchases, and record inflows into exchange-traded funds. Gold prices have gained more than 16% this year. Silver prices are building on its 147% rise last year as retail-investor flows and momentum-driven buying compounded a prolonged spell of tightness in physical markets for the metal.
Escalating tensions between the United States and NATO over Greenland has lent additional support to the gold prices on expectations of more financial and geopolitical uncertainty. Meanwhile, China extended its gold-buying spree for a fourteenth month in December, Reuters reported.
MCX gold price ended lower by₹378, or 0.24%, at₹1,55,963 per 10 grams on Friday. MCX silver prices jumped by₹7,311, or 2.23%, to end at₹3,34,600 per kg.
Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: Gold jewellery demand has weakened amid elevated prices, partially offset by strong demand for small bars and coins in key markets such as India, according to a Reuters report. Bar-and-coin buying has also been observed across Europe, although some investors have begun booking profits.
Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: Inflows into gold-backed ETFs are also underpinning prices as markets expect further US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year. Gold ETFs saw record inflows in 2025, led by North American funds, according to World Gold Council data, with annual inflows surging to $89 billion. In tonnage terms, inflows totalled 801 metric tons, the highest since their record in 2020.
Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: Central-bank gold buying has been a key driver of yellow metal prices in 2025. This momentum is expected to stay strong this year. Goldman Sachs forecasts purchases to average 60 metric tons a month as emerging-market central banks continue diversifying reserves into gold, Reuters reported.
Poland’s central bank aims to lift gold reserves to 700 tons from 550 tons reported during 2025-end. China’s central bank also extended its gold-buying spree for a 14th month in December.
Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: Analysts expect spot gold prices to climb further toward $6,000 this year on mounting global tensions as well as strong central-bank and retail demand, Reuters reported. The London Bullion Market Association’s annual precious metals forecast survey shows analysts projecting gold rising as high as $7,150 and averaging $4,742 in 2026. Goldman Sachs has raised its December 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 from $4,900.
Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: The yen rose over 1% to 153.99 per dollar on speculation over potential intervention. The New York Federal Reserve conducted rate checks on Friday, sources told Reuters, raising the chance of joint US-Japan intervention to halt the currency’s slide. The prospect of joint intervention to support the yen pulled the dollar lower and broadly lifted other currencies. A weak dollar has supported the gold and silver prices.
Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: Sanctions targeting Iran have reinforced market anxiety. Increased US pressure against Iran is pushing oil prices higher and lifting safe-haven gold to record peaks. Precious metals, including silver, have surged in a blistering rally so far this year, also aided by a softer dollar.

Strong support is placed at₹3,10,000 –₹3,20,000. A breakout above₹3,45,000 –₹3,50,000 may accelerate prices toward₹3,60,000 –₹3,80,000 and beyond, supported by supply tightness and industrial tailwinds, said Ponmudi R.

Key support rests at₹1,54,000 –₹1,55,000. A decisive breakout above₹1,59,000 –₹1,60,000 could open the path toward₹1,62,000 –₹1,65,000 and higher in the medium term, said Ponmudi R.
Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: COMEX silver price remains elevated near $101+, sustaining momentum within a powerful ascending channel. While minor exhaustion signals are visible, the $90–$92 zone continues to act as a solid base. Holding above the $100–$101 region keeps the structure aligned for further upside toward $105–$110 in the next leg of the rally, said Ponmudi R.
Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: Gold consolidates between $4,900–$4,970 after record highs, comfortably respecting its multi-year rising channel. The prior breakout zone around $4,500–$4,600 now acts as a strong long-term base. A sustained breakout above $5,000 is likely to trigger the next impulsive leg toward $5,200–$5,500, maintaining a clear buy-on-dips structure, said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money.
Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: The outlook for precious metals stays decisively bullish for the remainder of Q1 2026 and beyond. Tight supply, dual demand engines, and supportive global liquidity conditions favor continued medium-to-long-term upside. Near-term pullbacks, driven by overbought conditions or temporary dollar strength, are likely to remain shallow and should attract fresh accumulation. Silver, in particular, retains strong relative-performance potential, while gold continues to serve as the most reliable hedge against macro uncertainty, said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money.

Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: Gold prices have more than doubled over the last two years. Fresh from its best annual performance since 1979, gold rate has gained more than 15% so far this year due largely to the so-called debasement trade, whereby investors retreat from currencies and Treasuries.
Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: The dollar weakened amid a jump in the yen on concerns the US may assist Japan in currency intervention.

Housing demand remains strong in Gurugram, driven by a growing preference for quality residential options, both for ownership and rental, the management said.

While declining to comment on possible budget measures, Anthony Heredia, managing director and chief executive officer of Mahindra Manulife Mutual Fund, said that policy measures aimed at boosting foreign capital flows, either directly through tax incentives or indirectly, could help create economic momentum. After underperforming global peers for a year amid high valuations and low earnings growth, India's relative valuations are beginning to turn attractive in dollar terms, he said in an interview.Edited excerpts:
Investing always needs to be in context of what you are seeking to achieve and in what time frame. If one had a long-term view, say five years or more, I would expect to have over 40-50% in diversified flexi or multi-cap portfolios, 25-30% in multi-asset funds, which should cover gold and silver exposure, with the balance invested in international equities split equally between emerging markets, the US and select European markets.
As they say, successful investing has a lot to do with skill, but you also need a healthy dose of luck. And we seem to have been fortunate to be blessed with both in recent times. All of our equity funds, including mid and small-caps, have done well over the past year. That is also the case with our multi-asset allocation fund, and to my mind, given the recency bias that most investors have to gold and silver, our view is that multi-asset products should be at the core of future incremental allocation, at least over the next couple of quarters.
We think that a lot of heavy lifting to boost manufacturing, infra capex and more recently consumption has been done, and we should see results playing out in the medium term. What may require more attention at this point is an impetus to foreign capital flows, and anything that can be done in that regard, either directly via taxation measures or indirectly will help create economic momentum. Additionally, if there can be measures that create a positive tailwind for bond markets, that would also help.
We expect flows to moderate for fresh offerings. At the end of the day, this is a demand-supply game, and the extensive supply of IPOs (initial public offerings) is starting to weigh on secondary markets. The recent global headwinds too play a role in reducing the degree of positive sentiment. In that context, we would see appetite dropping, and investors becoming a lot more selective around where they chose to invest. Within MF, we don’t see a significant change given the large SIP anchor flows but expect a preference towards multi-asset and flexi/multi-cap diversified funds.
Most of these arguments tend to happen at market declines. If you look over the long term, Indian equities have delivered, and all investors who have remained invested, whether domestic or foreign, have benefited. Going forward, I would anchor my expectations from equity to be 2-3% higher than nominal GDP growth.
In our view, there is a lot happening, but not everything is being telegraphed for public consumption. My feeling is that this will evolve, and the winners will transition from only the producers of AI to others in the value chain, including the consumers of AI as well. And so, the story five years out may be very different in terms of what the impact of AI has been, relative to today. I see so many similarities between how the use of internet evolved from the early 2000s to today, and expect to see the same for AI, albeit in a much shorter time horizon. The challenge is that quite a few AI providers are competing to create capacities to serve customers in future. Thus, the capex is upfronted while monetizing revenue and profit pool participation is in the future and, hence, it is tough to start picking eventual winners. For now, the ecosystem of vendors for AI (chips) and vendors for AI companies (data centre, power, etc.) look a bigger beneficiary till the consuming AI businesses are able to monetize.
9) From your interactions with foreign investors, what's the feeling you get on strategic as well as portfolio investments?I think that the recent geopolitical events, and volatility in bond and currency markets, have meant that people are being more deliberate about committing future capital. From an FDI perspective, I think you will see momentum pick up as global macros get more stable. The core premise of Indian economy offering a wide consumer base with a positive demography, reform agenda and creation of world-class infrastructure, global opportunity for manufacturing remains intact. In terms of FPI flows, especially into equity, I think it’s a matter of when, and not if. Flows into emerging markets have been strong over the past six to nine months, at some point, it will turn for India as well. Indian markets had run up ahead of quite a few emerging markets in terms of valuations during calendar year 2023 (CY23) and CY24. In CY25 we saw a strong outperformance by many of those emerging markets and hence India looks to be almost there in terms of relative valuation attractiveness post the time and price correction in dollar terms.

Record outflows from exchange-traded funds held by Central Huijin Investment, a sovereign wealth fund, sent the clearest signal yet that Beijing is no longer simply propping up the market, but actively reining in the rally — a sharp break from past rescue playbooks.
While many investors see the selling as an effort to drain speculative excess from pockets of the technology sector rather than cool the broader market, the national team’s shift from one-way support to two-way trading is already changing behavior. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates Central Huijin sold $67.5 billion across 14 ETFs in just six sessions through Thursday.
“If enough people are watching what this player is doing, its actions could be enough to alter expectations,” said Chen Da, founder of Dante Research.
The ETF outflows have coincided with regulators’ efforts to tighten rules on margin financing, signaling unease over rapid gains in sectors such as rockets and AI applications, where profitability is unclear. The broader onshore benchmark CSI 300 has advanced 1.8% over the past month, while the chip-heavy Star 50 Index has jumped 16%.
“These days it’s probably smart to focus trading on the stocks that the team owns less of to avoid being in the line of fire,” said Wu Wei, a fund manager at Beijing Win Integrity Investment Management Co. “My trading has slowed a bit, because it’s not a bullish signal at the end of the day.”
While the national team’s trading activity won’t be revealed until ETFs’ quarterly reports, investors and analysts are busy estimating just how much ammunition there’s left. Central Huijin started aggressively investing in China’s ETFs in 2023, amassing $180 billion in such assets by the end of August 2025, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
The “scale of liquidation suggests a proactive effort to facilitate a price correction in overheated sectors,” wrote BI analysts including Rebecca Sin. After record outflows from a fund tracking the Star 50 Index, they estimate 5% of Central Huijin’s firepower is left for that product.
In recent sessions, intraday gains in certain gauges were quashed as turnover surged in ETFs that track the corresponding index — now widely seen as a sign that the national team is selling. On Wednesday, turnover for CSI 1000 ETFs started to climb as the underlying gauge rebounded nearly 2% within an hour of trading, before slipping lower.
Such patterns have repeated through the week, though strong risk appetite means the interventions have not always pushed indexes into the red. The E-fund ChiNext ETF saw sizable outflows on Thursday, but the gauge eventually recouped an intraday drop.
Though the selling surprised some investors, many view it as a step toward fostering a gradual bull market. Short-term volatility on the CSI 300 has fallen to the lowest since May. Trading activity onshore has eased from a frenzied pace of nearly 4 trillion yuan earlier this month.
“Instead of reading the state funds’ selling as a signal that the rally is over, we should consider this in the context of the structural, slow bull,” said Yang Ruyi, a fund manager at Shanghai Prospect Investment Management Co., adding that it makes sense for Central Huijin to reposition into other thematic ETFs.
For consultancy Z-Ben Advisors Ltd., the absorption of massive selloffs without major volatility shows strong institutional demand for A‑shares.
“Selling right now will free up positions so that they can provide a boost at a future time of risk,” said Zhu Zhenxin, head of Asymptote Investment Research in Beijing. “Such intervention will prevent a ‘mad bull’ like the one we saw in 2015.”
With national team flows under heavy scrutiny, investors may reignite the tech rally once they judge little remains to sell. Strong demand for tech stocks makes the euphoria hard to quell. Despite obvious signs of intervention, the CSI 1000 Index — home to rocket stocks like Hunan Aerospace Huanyu Communication Technology Co. and those along the chip supply chain — is still at its highest since 2017.
There’s also the lingering question of whether such heavy involvement in ETF trading is distorting market dynamics.
For now, Niu Chunbao, fund manager at Shanghai Wanji Asset Management Co., is looking at the blue chip stocks that have been swept up in the latest round of ETF selling.
“I am pleased to see the team exit some of the ETFs as gains in some stocks were making the market restless and impulsive,” he said. “Dips caused by their selling may render some value stocks even more attractive to us.”

livemint,markets,"Investors Hedge China, Tech Risks Amid Trump TACO Trade Drama","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://www.livemint.com/rss/markets', 'value': 'Investors Hedge China, Tech Risks Amid Trump TACO Trade Drama'}","While US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats over Greenland dominated the narrative for broader equity markets last week, investors were hedging risks elsewhere.","{'type': 'text/html', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://www.livemint.com/rss/markets', 'value': 'While US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats over Greenland dominated the narrative for broader equity markets last week, investors were hedging risks elsewhere.'}","[{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.livemint.com/market/investors-hedge-china-tech-risks-amid-trump-taco-trade-drama-11769354843658.html'}]",https://www.livemint.com/market/investors-hedge-china-tech-risks-amid-trump-taco-trade-drama-11769354843658.html,https://www.livemint.com/market/investors-hedge-china-tech-risks-amid-trump-taco-trade-drama-11769354843658.html,False,"Sun, 25 Jan 2026 20:57:23 +0530","time.struct_time(tm_year=2026, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=25, tm_hour=15, tm_min=27, tm_sec=23, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=25, tm_isdst=0)","While US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats over Greenland dominated the narrative for broader equity markets last week, investors were hedging risks elsewhere.
Only three weeks into 2026, the market pattern is similar to last year: Trump makes threats, markets start to show signs of upset then, as the tension de-escalates over a few days, stocks resume a grind higher.
For volatility markets, it’s an all-too familiar quick spike and reversal: The Cboe Volatility Index jumped Tuesday, then quickly retreated to below the level from the previous Friday, with the futures curve ending the week in an almost identical shape.
Meanwhile, away from the Trump-driven headlines that moved the broader indexes and the VIX, some investors were putting on hedges against geopolitical risks that could pressure shares of Chinese companies and against the potential for disappointing tech earnings.
Last week, investors bought about 400,000 lots of March-expiring puts in the iShares China Large-Cap ETF , along with 20,000 contracts in the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF and 150,000 of Xtrackers Harvest CSI China A-Shares ETF puts.
“Without an obvious specific catalyst, these investors may simply be positioning for an escalation in US-China tensions, perhaps following China’s recent criticism of the US’s trade deal with Taiwan,” Christopher Jacobson, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group, wrote in a note.
There’s a sense among strategists that investors are becoming better positioned for the so-called TACO trade, which is limiting how much, and for how long, volatility spikes.
“It seems very much like he’s playing this playbook of like, ‘I’m going to go in kind of mad dog style. No one really knows what I could do.’ And then you almost need the market to have a tantrum and then he will back off,” said Amy Wu Silverman, head of derivatives strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “From an options perspective, it’s when you see those potholes, those are pretty good signals of getting short volatility or reaching for a little upside.”
Even some of the geopolitical tensions have had limited impact on volatility. Trump’s framing around the Greenland deal in terms of national security is potentially the sort of justification that China could point to when articulating its own terms over Taiwan.
“Markets appear increasingly desensitized to breaches of international laws — whether in Venezuela, Iran, or Greenland,” said Antoine Bracq, head of advisory at Lighthouse Canton. “A similar indifference has prevailed in response to military exercises around Taiwan and the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.”
Hedging against declines in semiconductor stocks also picked up ahead of earnings releases expected this week from some of the biggest tech names, including Apple Inc., Tesla Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. Investors bought Jan. 30 puts in Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp. and Broadcom Inc.
“For now, any market corrections are likely to remain short-lived as long as the US economy is perceived as resilient. In this context, a VIX level above 20 could represent an attractive selling opportunity for retail investors,” said Bracq, who cites technology sector disappointment and labor market deterioration as factors that could change the low volatility regime.
With this backdrop and retail investors still willing to buy the dip, VIX spikes will continue to be short lived, as long as data point toward further Federal Reserve rate cuts and a US economy that keeps growing. That could change if unemployment and inflation push high enough to slow the retail flow.
“Retail have been a big part of the ‘buy the dip’ trade — so that is a risk if those buyers disappear, which can happen with rising unemployment if they have less disposable income,” said Antoine Porcheret, head of institutional structuring for the UK, Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Citigroup Inc.
Market watchers are also focusing on any changes in market structure that may signal a shift in the volume of volatility for sale via zero-day—to-expiry options or the Quantitative Investment Strategy space. UBS Group AG derivatives strategists note that more recently 0DTEs have contributed to a shorter gamma profile, which could drive greater intraday volatility as dealers rebalance, a change from the usual positioning.
VIX dealer positioning and exchange-traded products on the index — which have seen outflows recently — are other areas to watch. Monetization of long volatility ETP bets during periods of market stress can dampen VIX spikes. Now that positioning is lighter, that stabilizing influence may be diminished, potentially increasing VIX reactivity.

Capex growth is expected to stay central on the agenda, but it is imperative to address opportunities of AI-led growth, digital infrastructure, manufacturing expansion and energy transition.
Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) play a critical role in financing parts of the economy where traditional channels are less effective. Early-stage companies, infrastructure projects, stressed or transitional assets and MSMEs increasingly rely on patient, risk-tolerant capital.
Having been part of the investing ecosystem for over two decades and experienced the various market cycles, I see first-hand how investor appetite for alternative assets in India has evolved. Private equity, venture capital, private credit and real asset funds are no longer niche products; they are becoming essential components of long-term capital allocation. Yet, despite strong demand and a growing domestic savings pool, India’s AIF ecosystem remains constrained by structural and policy frictions.
Over the past few years, capital raising has become more challenging amid global tightening and higher risk aversion. This has made domestic policy clarity even more important. Investors committing capital to funds with long time horizons need certainty of a stable regulatory and tax framework throughout the life of the fund.
If India wants to meaningfully expand its alternative investment base, several targeted steps can make a tangible difference.
First, harmonising taxation across AIF categoriesshould be a priority. A uniform and transparent pass-through regime would reduce complexity, align India with global fund jurisdictions and improve fund economics for investors.
Second, enabling broader domestic participationis essential. While investor protection must remain paramount, calibrated mechanisms such as regulated feeder structures or revised thresholds for sophisticated investors can deepen the capital pool and reduce over-dependence on a small set of institutional investors.
Third, strengthening the private credit frameworkcan unlock significant growth. Credit AIFs are increasingly filling gaps in MSME and growth-stage financing. Policy support in the form of risk-sharing mechanisms, co-investment platforms or recognition within priority sector frameworks could materially scale this segment.
Fourth, improving operational easewould enhance India’s attractiveness as a fund domicile. Simplified compliance, digital reporting and faster approvals for cross-border investments would reduce friction and lower costs for both fund managers and investors.
Last but not the least is Strategic Focus on Growth Sectorsto signal a clear policy emphasis on sectors like Technology and deep tech (AI, semiconductors, biotech), Renewables and transition finance, Logistics and supply chain infrastructure and Healthcare where AIFs can have transformative impact.
Incentives whether fiscal, regulatory or infrastructure-related can steer private capital into these strategic domains, accelerating innovation and competitiveness.
From a fund manager’s perspective, the Budget’s importance lies less in immediate inflows and more in thesignal it sends to long-term capital. Alternative investments are built on trust - trust that capital can be deployed efficiently, returns realised predictably and policies applied consistently.
What markets want is not dramatic reform, butthoughtful, durable changethat enables confidence and long-term participation.

These tests encountered a limited impact on domestic demand, which holds a healthy forecast of average real GDP growth of +7.0% in FY26 and FY27.
India began the new year by touching a new market high, but the gains were short-lived following the raid in Venezuela. This event caused bouts of volatility in oil prices and continues to be upbeat, though albeit at a slower pace, amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding other oil-producing nations, including Iran.
Despite this double whammy, the overall impact on the global oil market has been limited. Despite this dual risk, the overall impact on the global oil market has been limited, supported by lower output from both countries, ample global supply, and a subdued demand outlook.
Thus far, domestic unrest in Venezuela and Iran appears to be under control, aided by international intervention and support, which, if sustained, could restrict adverse spillovers into global markets.
This stability is supported by maintained high production from OPEC and the U.S., along with the probability of reopening of the Venezuelan market. Such a scenario is expected to benefit key importers like India and China in the long-term.
Another set of volatility to India was exposed when Trump signed the Russia Act to impose tariffs up to 500% on nations importing oil from Russia. For India, Russian oil was the biggest source of input in 2025, which lately has reduced but continues to be at a good rate estimated holding the third position.
This has affected the performance of the domestic stock market, as both domestic and international investors have been eagerly waiting for a US-India trade deal, which is probably getting extended given the US’s high expectations to tap Russian oil, along with to increase access to domestic Agriculture and Dairy market.
The global geo-political risk further escalated during this week when Trump intended to expand his global rampage to buy out Greenland. Strong opposition from the EU led to Trump proclaiming a new tariff on the EU of up 10%, being used as a mass of weapons. Market concerns eased only after a more measured address by Trump at Davos and the subsequent withdrawal of this fresh tariff threats.
Despite the dampening of the geo-political risk standpoint, the texture of the global cooperation has been damaged. It has affected the overall strength and risk-taking appetite of global equities with an uprise in bond yields. Heavenly metals continue to trade at upticks, though volatility of price movement has increased due to constant uncertainty about policies. The global volatility index and the India VIX index are on rise.
This has enlarged the effect on India, which was already in a sell-off mode, especially for FIIs, due to low earning growth compared to high valuation and abbreviations in the US-India trade agreement. Hence, profit booking is encroaching at every higher level as overall sentiment remains cautious.
We advise investors to maintain a measured short-term outlook and avoid panic-driven selling during this volatile phase, as discussions between the U.S. and India continue with a constructive bias.

The summit, scheduled for January 27, will focus on a long-pending Free Trade Agreement that has been under discussion for over two decades and remains challenging to conclude due to sensitivities surrounding agriculture, carbon border levies, services, and non-tariff barriers.
The India–European Union free trade agreement (FTA), slated for announcement on January 27, is expected to reduce costs and boost bilateral trade without undermining domestic industry, according to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), as quoted by theTimes of India.
India–EU merchandise trade exceeded $136 billion in FY2025. GTRI noted that tariff cuts under the pact would mainly lower input costs, strengthen value-chain integration and lift trade volumes—typical FTA benefits that support producers and consumers on both sides.
"" The two are not rivals but partners operating on different rungs of the value chain,"" with India focused on labour-intensive and downstream production, while the EU supplies capital goods, advanced technology and industrial inputs. This structural complementarity explains why an India-EU free trade agreement is likely to lower costs and expand trade rather than threaten domestic industry,"" Ajay Srivasatava, GTRI founder, was quoted as saying by TOI.
Indian exports to the EU, such as smartphones, apparel, footwear, tyres, pharmaceuticals, auto components, refined fuels and cut diamonds, largely substitute the EU’s imports from other countries rather than compete with European manufacturing, much of which has already been offshored. Meanwhile, the EU supplies India with high-end machinery, aircraft, key electronic components, chemicals, advanced medical devices and metal scrap.
According to Sandeep Pandey, Co-founder of Basav Capital, the Indian stock market is likely to see a gap-up opening on Tuesday, January 27, highlighting that India-EU trade deal optimism is expected to fuel business volume of export oriented companies.
Pandey further explained that the trade deal is expected raise US dollar inflow leading to appreciation in Indian Rupee. The Rupee hit all-time low of 92 per dollar on Friday, however, recovered marginally to settle at 91.88.
The India-EU trade deal is also likely to benefit export oriented companies. “This is expected to raise US dollar inflow leading to appreciation in Indian Rupee. So, export oriented companies are expected to report better earnings in upcoming quarters. Appreciation in rupee will fuel demand in consumer durable segment,” Pandey said.
Meanwhile, gold and silver prices are likely to continue its bullish trend in the coming week, according to market experts.
Anuj Gupta, Director, Ya Wealth Research & Advisory, believes that both precious metals may witness a mild correction in the near term, but the broader outlook for both metals remains bullish over the long run.
“ Gold is expected to continue its role as a key safe-haven asset amid ongoing global uncertainties, while silver demand is likely to stay resilient, supported by its dual appeal as both a precious and industrial metal,” Gupta said.
On the technical outlook, Gupta said that Gold is trading with key support seen at₹1,52,000 ($4,930), followed by a stronger base at₹1,48,000 ($4,870). On the upside, immediate resistance is placed at₹1,60,000 ($5,020), with a higher hurdle at₹1,65,000 ($5,080).
Meanwhile, Silver has support at₹3,25,000 ($98), with the next downside level at₹3,15,000 ($93). Resistance for silver is seen at₹3,40,000 ($105), and a decisive move above this could open the door toward₹3,50,000 ($110).

Spot silver jumped as much as 6.9% to $102.87 an ounce on Friday, taking year-to-date gains beyond 40%, after prices more than doubled in 2025. Gold also rose to a new all-time high, inching closer to the $5,000-an-ounce level.
Investor sentiment for precious metals strengthened during the first year of US President Donald Trump’s second term, amid rising uncertainty around trade, geopolitics, and monetary policy.
Concerns that silver could face US tariffs sparked a rush to move metal into New York, eventually leading to a historic short squeeze in London in October.
“ Precious metals continue to trade in a structurally strong bull market as we move deeper into 2026, with momentum firmly intact despite intermittent corrections and elevated price levels. The current phase reflects healthy consolidation rather than exhaustion, with long-term fundamentals continuing to dominate short-term volatility,” said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money.
Renewed criticism of the Fed by Trump, alongside US military action in Venezuela and threats to annex Greenland, has reinforced the so-called debasement trade—where investors shift away from government bonds and currencies toward alternative safe havens such as gold. Bullion is up about 15% so far this year, building on last year’s strongest annual gain in nearly four decades.
At the same time, the global silver market has been running a supply shortfall for the past five years. Rising prices have sparked a surge in retail buying. In China, investors have flocked to silver as a cheaper substitute for gold, while in the US, intense demand has overwhelmed dealers.
Silver’s gains have come despite a US decision in January to delay imposing import tariffs on critical minerals. Trump said bilateral agreements would be negotiated to secure adequate supplies, including the possibility of price floors, while keeping the option of tariffs open.
Beyond its role as an investment, silver is also vital to industry due to its high electrical conductivity, with the solar sector emerging as a major source of demand.
In the previous budget, the Finance Minister had slashed import duties on gold and silver to 6% from 15% in July 2024 to curb smuggling.
“ Looking ahead into the remainder of Q1 2026 and beyond, the outlook for precious metals stays decisively bullish. Tight supply, dual demand engines, and supportive global liquidity conditions favour continued medium-to-long-term upside. Near-term pullbacks, driven by overbought conditions or temporary dollar strength, are likely to remain shallow and should attract fresh accumulation. Silver, in particular, retains strong relative-performance potential, while gold continues to serve as the most reliable hedge against macro uncertainty,” said Ponmudi.
Speaking on the technical outlook of MCX Gold prices, Ponmudi said that the yellow metal is trading near₹1,57,000–₹1,58,000 per 10 grams, consolidating within a well-defined upward channel after lifetime peaks.
“ Key support rests at₹1,54,000–₹1,55,000. A decisive breakout above₹1,59,000–₹1,60,000 could open the path toward₹1,62,000–₹1,65,000 and higher in the medium term,” he added.
Meanwhile, on the MCX Silver prices outlook, he added, “ The white metal trades in the₹3,30,000–₹3,40,000 range per kg, maintaining bullish channel dynamics amid heightened volatility. Strong support is placed at₹3,10,000–₹3,20,000. A breakout above₹3,45,000–₹3,50,000 may accelerate prices toward₹3,60,000–₹3,80,000 and beyond, supported by supply tightness and industrial tailwinds.”

Stocks that are priced for perfection tend to correct sharply as earnings visibility weakens and risk appetite declines. However, there are always a few companies that hold their ground. Despite trading at high price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, their stock prices don't fall much even when broader markets turn volatile.
This contrast often creates confusion. On the surface, elevated valuations should make these stocks vulnerable. But markets don't look at valuation in isolation, especially during corrections. Instead, they tend to differentiate between stocks where confidence breaks quickly and those where conviction remains intact.
This is why some high P/E stocks stay resilient when the market corrects. We look at three stocks that continue to trade at elevated valuations despite weak market breadth, yet have held their ground through the correction.
Laurus Labs Ltd is a research-driven pharmaceutical and biotechnology company. Laurus operates through a diverse portfolio that includes Generics (API and FDF), Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) services. It holds leadership positions in APIs and Finished Dosage Forms across therapeutic areas, including antiretrovirals, oncology, and cardiovascular.
In H1 FY26, total income from operations increased 33% year-on-year to₹3,223 crore. The company reported Ebitda of₹818 crore, with margins expanding to 25.4% due to improved operating leverage and improved product mix. Net profit also grew by almost 10 times to₹356 crore, albeit from a low base of₹33 crore in H1 FY25.
Strong financial momentum and various earnings triggers have kept its share price elevated, even though it trades at a rich multiple. Its share price is currently trading at₹1,030, up 76% from last year. Valuations are at a price-to-earnings multiple of 81 times, a premium to the industry median and competitors like Divi's Laboratories Ltd (65) and Sai Life Sciences Ltd (61).
It is pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy focused on capacity additions and new technology approaches. Laurus proposes investing about $600 million over eight years to build a world-class pharmaceutical manufacturing complex. Laurus continues to invest in growth, with an estimated capex of about₹1,000 crore in FY26.
The company is also investing about₹250 crore (opex and capex combined) over the next three years, specifically in fast-growing Cell and Gene Therapy and related capabilities. It is constructing dedicated capacities to meet growing demand, particularly for complex small molecules. The CDMO division is transitioning from early-phase to commercial deliveries, which requires significant upfront capex and validation time (18-24 months).
The company expects improved growth for the rest of the year. Management is optimistic that Ebitda margins will continue to improve over the next 12 to 24 months as operating leverage kicks in and the product mix shifts further towards high-margin CDMO and complex commercial assets.
A key operational objective is to improve the fixed asset turnover ratio from the current 0.9x to 1.1x over the next two years. This would mark a return to historical levels, driven by better utilization of the existing asset base.
Laurus is also expanding into animal health with facilities currently undergoing multiple product validations. A commercial asset is already being supplied and is expected to generate a strong revenue contribution in FY27 upon validation. Another segment, Crop Science, is also in the qualification phase.
Laurus is positioning itself for the future by building capabilities in cutting-edge therapies, though significant revenue is not expected for another 3 to 5 years. A new Gene/ADC facility is under construction in Hyderabad and is expected to be completed by the end of 2026. This facility will handle plasmids, viral vectors, and bio-conjugation.
The company's business aligns with the rising demand for recycling. The management anticipates that formalizing the recycling sector will increase opportunities for organized players like Jain. The mandated minimum recycled content in new products (5% each for copper and aluminium from 2028) is expected to shift market share from unorganized to organized sectors.
Jain Resource serves a diverse client base of over 250 customers spanning more than 20 countries. JRR exhibits strong customer stickiness, as evidenced by a high contribution from existing clients. In H1 FY26, repeat customers accounted for nearly 88% of its revenue, providing sticky revenue visibility.
This strength is also reflected in its share price. Since listing in October 2025, the company has delivered a 19% return at the current price of₹381. This is despite a valuation premium of 52 times, the highest in the sector, with Pondy Oxides (42) and Gravita (29) commanding much lower valuations.
Financial momentum also supports this valuation. Revenue grew 27% year-over-year to₹3,663 crore in H1 FY26, driven by increased volumes. Ebitda increased 37% to₹250 crore, while margins expanded 52bps to 6.8%. Net profit surged by 38% to₹155 crore. This growth was led by the lead segment, which witnessed 47% volume expansion.
Management estimates that the historical growth rate of 20-25% will continue for the present product portfolio. And to keep the momentum going, given the sectoral tailwind, Jain is also expanding capacity and diversifying into newer verticals.
JRR maintains a policy of adding 20% ​​additional capacity each year to stay ahead of demand. Currently, lead capacity utilization is nearly 100%, so the company plans to install additional refining furnaces to maintain this growth buffer. In addition, the company expects the copper segment to lead future growth, as it yields the highest Ebitda.
The company is setting up a manufacturing facility to produce copper cathodes, wire rods, and busbars. It expects operations to start in Q1FY27. This move is expected to significantly enhance the bottom line, with management projecting an increase in Ebitda margins of 3-4% within the copper segment alone, driven by value-addition.
Jain has also entered into a joint venture (55% stake) with the US-based C&Y Group to set up a₹60 crore copper scrap recycling plant. This facility is expected to come online next year, leveraging C&Y's electric-motor scrap-sourcing capabilities. Beyond the core metals, Jain is also exploring new recycling domains to future-proof its business model over the next 2-3 years.
The company is conducting advanced studies on tyre recycling, solar panel recycling, and e-waste processing, and if these projects are completed, capital expenditure is expected to be₹100 crore over the next few years.
Syrma SGS Technology Ltd has steadily built its position as a meaningful player in India's Electronic System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) landscape. The company has a diversified offering as a full-stack manufacturing partner, offering integrated box-build solutions and customized end-of-line testing.
Beyond core EMS, the company has carved out niches in the Radio Frequency Identification. It also supplies critical communication solutions to segments such as public safety, oil and gas, medical devices, and paramilitary forces. These are areas where entry barriers are higher, and vendor relationships tend to be long-term.
Against this backdrop, Syrma's stock performance has held up relatively well compared to peers, even during periods of sector volatility. The company is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 56 times, at₹668 per share. It has delivered a 43% return over the last year. This resilience comes from Syrma's shift in business model.
In H1 FY26, revenue grew a modest 4.4% year-on-year to₹2,093 crore, largely on the back of steady order-book execution. The top line number looks unremarkable. But a closer look at profitability tells a different story. Ebitda rose sharply by 60% to₹227 crore, while margins expanded by 370 basis points to 10.7%. As a result, net profit nearly doubled to₹116 crore.
This divergence comes from Syrma's strategic rebalancing of its business mix. Syrma is moving away from lower-margin consumer electronics toward higher-margin industrial and automotive segments. The transition has slowed the near-term revenue momentum, but is yielding margin gains.
The consumer vertical illustrates this shift clearly. Revenue from this segment declined 23% to₹683 crore, reducing its share of total revenue from 40% to 32%. This drag explains the subdued topline growth. On the other hand, Industrial revenues rose 20% to₹552 crore, accounting for 26% of total revenue.
Automotive followed closely, growing 24% and contributing another 24%. Healthcare posted a 21% increase, while exports surged 35%, underscoring the company's growing relevance beyond domestic consumer demand.
Visibility on future growth remains strong. Syrma's order book stands at around₹5,800 crore, translating into about 1.5 years of revenue visibility. On the back of this pipeline, management has reiterated its guidance of 30% organic revenue growth for FY26, with FY27 expected to be even stronger.
Syrma is also diversifying into new growth engines. The company is actively diversifying through acquisitions and greenfield investments, particularly in defence, PCB manufacturing, and solar energy. These segments are aligned with long-term domestic manufacturing priorities and offer scope for scale over the next few years.
In defence, following the Elcome acquisition, Syrma plans to consolidate its financials from Q4FY26. The current defence business, which is approximately₹200 crore, is targeted to grow to₹300-350 crore in the next 2-3 years. PCB manufacturing is a big opportunity, in which it is investing₹1,500 crore.
Trial production is expected to start in Q3/Q4FY27, with revenues projected to kick in FY28. The management estimates that the PCB industry typically operates at an asset turnover ratio of 1.2-1.5x. Consequently, the₹1,500 crore investment is expected to generate peak revenue of about₹2,500 crore once fully operational.
Meanwhile, the core industrial and automotive businesses continue to offer steady tailwinds. Rising electronic content in vehicles, alongside the gradual adoption of EVs, should support automotive growth. Industrial demand is being driven by data centres and power electronics, both in India and overseas.

However, mcap of Hindustan Unilever climbed₹12,311.86 crore to₹5,66,733.16 crore.

""NIMs are likely to drop (driven by loan mix change), while the impact of the recent repo rate cut will bear fruit, largely in Q4. Opex trend would lend support to core PPoP growth.
Monitor the asset quality. Q3, a seasonally soft quarter on agri slippages and trajectory of technical slippages will need to be watched,"" the brokerage firm said.
Brokerage firm Axis Securities anticipates revenue to rise by 18% year-on-year (YoY), driven by a 16% increase in volumes due to strong domestic growth, higher exports and increased vehicle prices over the past year.
“ EBITDA margins are expected to increase by ~51 bps YoY and remain flat QoQ, supported by a richer product mix and cost control initiatives,” the firm said in a note.
According to Elara Capital, ITC revenue growth likely to be 7%, led by 5% cigarette volume growth, however, the recent tax increase by the government will remain an overhang.
The brokerage firm further expects the FMCG giant to post 7.2% YoY and 0.1% growth in EBITDA for the December quarter FY26.

Sectoral performance remained broadly weak, with metals being the sole outperformer, gaining close to 1%, while all other major sectoral indices closed in the red. Broader markets witnessed sharper pressure, as the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices plunged by approximately 4% and 6% respectively, reflecting risk aversion. Meanwhile, the rupee slipped to a fresh record low. In a key development, the Reserve Bank of India announced liquidity infusion of over₹2 lakh crore through multiple measures, aimed at easing financial conditions and supporting the banking system,” said Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi.
“ However, supportive derivatives indicators such as the Put–Call Ratio (PCR) at 0.75 suggest limited downside from current levels. The recent RBI liquidity measures could help arrest the ongoing decline in Nifty and Bank Nifty, potentially paving the way for a recovery toward the psychologically important 25,600–26,800 zone in the coming weeks, especially with the monthly expiry and the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting. That said, uncertainty surrounding global tariff developments may cap aggressive upside, and caution is advised at higher levels. Immediate resistance for Nifty is seen in the 25,600–25,800 zone, where supply pressure is likely to emerge,” Dongre said.
“ Overall, the market outlook remains cautious, with a constructive bias emerging only if Nifty sustains above the 25,600–25,800 zone and Bank Nifty holds above 58,000. Traders are advised to adopt a buy-on-dips approach, remain selective, focus on relative sector strength, and closely track global cues and geopolitical developments for clearer directional signals,” said Dongre.

Ongoing geopolitical concerns, caution ahead of the Union Budget 2026, and mixed Q3 earnings further dampened the overall market sentiment.
Ponmudi further explained that elevated FII short positions, oversold momentum indicators, and pre-Budget positioning could trigger bouts of short covering. That said, the durability of any recovery is likely to remain contingent on global cues, earnings follow-through, and investor positioning ahead of the Union Budget.
“ Investor expectations from the Union Budget are anchored around fiscal prudence, with the fiscal deficit seen at around 4.2–4.3% of GDP, alongside a continued thrust on capital expenditure—particularly in infrastructure, defence, and railways. Markets are also factoring in modest tax rationalisation, targeted sectoral incentives, and policy measures to support MSMEs and export-oriented sectors in the face of tariff-related challenges. Reforms aimed at improving capital market depth and efficiency also feature prominently on the investor wishlist, as participants look for policy clarity to anchor sentiment amid an uncertain global backdrop,” Ponmudi said.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is all set to present the Union Budget 2026 in Parliament on Sunday, February 1, which will be the key factor to drive the Indian stock market this week.
The US Federal Meeting is scheduled for this week from January 27 to January 28. According to market experts, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its meeting on Wednesday.
“Early-week sentiment found some support from earnings upgrades at Infosys and selective strength in banking stocks; these positives were quickly overshadowed by earnings disappointments and muted results from sectoral peers,” said Ponmudi of Enrich Money.
L&T, ITC, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Enterprises, Axis Bank, GAIL, and NTPC are among the companies to declare their Q3 results FY26 next week.
India continues to be actively involved in global trade matters, Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told PTI on Thursday, projecting confidence after US President Donald Trump voiced optimism over a potential trade deal.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said that he is optimistic about securing a “good trade deal” with India, and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “fantastic leader” and a close friend.
According to Reuters, the US President said on Thursday that he had reached an agreement with NATO granting the United States permanent and unrestricted access to Greenland. However, the specifics of any such deal remain unclear. The report also noted that Greenland’s Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said he lacked clarity on several aspects of the arrangement.
This uncertainty surrounding the purported US–NATO Greenland agreement continues to weigh on market sentiment.
Gold edged closer to the $5,000/ounce mark as geopolitical tensions and fresh concerns over the Federal Reserve’s independence fueled a record-setting surge.
Bullion touched a new peak above $4,967 on Friday and was heading for a weekly gain of nearly 8%, helped by a softer dollar. Silver also jumped to an all-time high just under $100 an ounce, as the US dollar index was on course for its weakest week in seven months, making precious metals more affordable for most buyers.
According to Ponmudi, the index has stabilised after testing the 24,900–25,000 zone, forming a short-term base.
“ Holding above 25,000–25,100 could support consolidation or a modest rebound toward 25,300–25,500. A decisive move above 25,700 may open the path to 26,000+, while a break below 25,000 risks a slide toward 24,800–24,500. Options positioning suggests a range-bound bias. Call writing is heavy around 25,300–25,400, indicating resistance, while put support is visible near 25,000–25,200. The Put-Call Ratio remains subdued, reflecting cautious sentiment,” Ponmudi said.
“ The rejection from the 59,000–59,100 supply zone confirmed strong distribution at higher levels. Post-breakdown, the index remained heavy and consolidated near the day’s lows, indicating the absence of meaningful dip buying. Immediate support is placed near 58,500, where marginal buying interest was seen, while any recovery is likely to face stiff resistance in the 58,900–59,000 zone, now a major supply area. The trend structure of lower highs and lower lows remains intact, and unless the index regains broken supports with volume confirmation, the near-term bias continues to favour a sell-on-rise approach,” he said.

The world’s No. 2 economy is painting a picture of consumer-sensitive sectors lagging further behind industries linked to manufacturing and technology. That’s making Wall Street firms including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Asset Management more bullish toward Chinese companies from machinery producers to power grid builders.
These Chinese firms have thrived on the world’s appetite for advanced manufacturing or surging demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure.
China’s economy has grown more bifurcated in the past year. New industrial forces have helped deliver surprisingly robust exports that defied President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Meanwhile, domestic consumption remains anemic amid a prolonged property downturn. For investors, that split is reshaping their strategies, rewarding selective bets on global-facing industrial champions rather than those on a broad consumer-led recovery.
“There are clearly two very different Chinas at the moment,” William Bratton, head of cash equity research in Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas Exane, wrote in a note. “We have a clear preference for the materials, industrials, and technology sectors and sub-industries over their consumer-facing peers – a preference which is reflected in earnings trends and the recent economic data.”
Much of China’s export strength is being driven by equipment makers, electronic component manufacturers and metal miners that are tied to global demand for AI infrastructure. China XD Electric Co., a key contractor of ultra-high-voltage grid construction, has surged 75% this year, while electrical component-maker TBEA Co. is up about 28%.
Morgan Stanley was the latest to join the chorus of bullish calls, favoring a group of stocks that included Sany Heavy Industry Co., Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co., Han’s Laser Technology Industry Group Co. and Wuxi Lead Intelligent Equipment Co.
“Construction machinery is entering an improvement cycle, with the domestic recovery continuing along with overseas demand,” the bank’s analysts including Sheng Zhong wrote in a note, citing “decent growth momentum” for exports.
In contrast, consumer stocks have lagged. Shares of Fuyao Glass Industry Group Co. are down 5.4% this year, while those of Great Wall Motor Co. have fallen 4.6%.
“Recent conversations with investors indicate that institutional investors remain cautious about domestic recovery, focusing instead on the earnings growth potential of the ‘going global’ theme,” Chaoping Zhu, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, wrote in a note.
“Policymakers are emphasizing advanced manufacturing and technology as new growth drivers, with the stock market playing a key role in supporting capital formation and household wealth allocation,” Zhu added.
To be sure, the outlook of Chinese industrials firms may turn sour if they face stronger pushbacks from countries worried about an influx of cheap goods. Meanwhile, as Beijing lists reviving consumption as its top policy task this year, some observers argue that the sector’s valuations may be attractive enough for bargain hunters.
For now, the momentum of the two-speed economy appears intact: Earnings forecasts for the CSI 300 Industrials Index have climbed 10% over the past six months, compared with just a 5% increase for its consumer peer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“I think industrials outperformance will continue because that’s where there’s a lot of structural growth that is happening,” said Min Lan Tan, head of the Asia Pacific chief investment office at UBS Group AG. “Nobody can afford to really step back from this AI race, so we think that will continue to drive the industrial sector.”

TACO, of course, is an acronym for Trump Always Chickens Out. It was the ticket to a recovery this past week after the president triggered a selloff over his gambit to acquire Greenland for the U.S. When the dust settled, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.5% for the week, while the S&P 500 index lost 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1%.
The small weekly move belied a turbulent stretch. Donald Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric about Greenland unnerved global stock and bond markets as European leaders signaled they were willing to launch a retaliatory “bazooka"" to maintain sovereignty over the world’s largest island. Markets rebounded as the president calmed nerves on Wednesday, backing off his threats and citing a “framework of a future deal"" over Greenland.
The fracas is far from over, as Greenland and other geopolitical risks remain elevated.
“The stock market is likely to remain headline-sensitive for some time,"" notes Alexander Guiliano, chief investment officer of Resonate Wealth Partners. “This week’s market action is an important reminder for investors to not allow political headlines out of Washington to affect their portfolio.""
Many investors were happy to buy the dip. Importantly, some solid economic data backed the rebound. Third-quarter gross domestic product expanded at a 4.4% annualized pace, up from 3.8% in the second quarter; jobless claims were subdued; and inflation data were in line with expectations.
Also encouraging: Transportation stocks hit a record, historically a bullish signal for the economy and market strength. Investors also got a better read on the American consumer, the engine of the U.S. economy. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index rose in January, despite geopolitical upheaval.
“The wealth effect is alive and well with consumers,"" says Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. “It’s hard to be negative with GDP over 4%.""
While investors who bet on TACO aced the test, another kind of stress test is coming soon with fourth-quarter tech earnings.
Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are scheduled to report results over the next few trading sessions. Tech has been wobbling lately, with several Magnificent Seven stocks lagging behind the broader market. While some tech names are doing great—Advanced Micro Devices comes to mind—the chip sector is on edge, with Intel tumbling double digits on weak guidance.
Greenland, meanwhile, is one of several geopolitical flashpoints that remain unresolved. U.S. tensions with Iran remain high as Trump said he is sending an “armada"" of U.S. warships to the Middle East.
One clear beneficiary of the turmoil: precious metals. Silver has been unstoppable, hitting $100 for the first time in history with a 43% year-to-date gain. Gold, up 15% so far in January, hit another record and is hovering just below $5,000 an ounce.
The gains for precious metals, combined with elevated volatility and weakness in the dollar, suggest markets could be in for a wintry mix. “All this suggests market participants don’t believe this week’s other storm—the geopolitical one—has completely faded,"" says Joe Mazzola, head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab.

Earlier this year, Paisalo Digital raised₹188.5 crore as part of its efforts to optimise funding costs, improve capital efficiency and support business expansion.

Paisalo Digital also noted that the capital infusion is expected to help lower its overall cost of funds, reinforce its medium-term capital base and expand its lending capacity.

The performance underscores Kotak Mahindra Bank’s ability to deliver consistent earnings growth despite a challenging operating environment for the banking sector.
The bank reported a sequential improvement in asset quality during the December quarter, with gross non-performing assets (GNPA) declining to 1.30% from 1.39% in Q2 FY26. Net non-performing assets (NNPA) also edged lower to 0.31% compared with 0.32% in the previous quarter.

Total customer assets under management also grew 15% YoY to₹787,950 crore, supported by steady growth across businesses. Domestic mutual fund assets under management increased 20% YoY to₹586,610 crore during the quarter.
The bank’s consolidated net worth stood at₹175,251 crore, while book value per share rose to₹176 following the 1:5 share subdivision that became effective on January 14, 2026. On an annualised basis, consolidated return on assets (RoA) for Q3 FY26 was 2.10%, while return on equity (RoE) stood at 11.39%.
On a standalone basis, net advances increased 16% YoY to₹480,673 crore, while customer assets rose 15% to₹529,455 crore. Period-end deposits grew 15% YoY to₹542,638 crore, with the CASA ratio reported at 41.3%. The credit-to-deposit ratio stood at 88.6%, and the bank’s customer base expanded to 5.1 crore. Average cost of funds declined to 4.54% from 5.06% in Q3 FY25, reflecting improved funding efficiency.
Separately, the bank said its board of directors has approved plans to raise up to₹15,000 crore through the issuance of unsecured, redeemable, non-convertible debentures on a private placement basis during FY 2026–27. The proposed fundraising may be carried out in one or more tranches or series, subject to shareholder approval and receipt of necessary regulatory clearances.

Media reports citing PhonePe’s Updated Draft Red Herring Prospectus (UDRHP) have highlighted a transaction from 2025 in which General Atlantic raised its stake to 8.9% through a $600 million investment. This deal has also been widely misunderstood as a liquidity event for insiders.
The limited size of the OFS — just enough to satisfy SEBI’s public float norms — sends a clear signal. Founders, employees and the overwhelming majority of investors are choosing to retain their holdings, reflecting strong long-term confidence in PhonePe’s business fundamentals, growth prospects and competitive position.
At a time when IPOs are often accompanied by significant secondary sales and early exits, PhonePe’s shareholder behaviour stands out. Instead of seeking near-term liquidity, investors are staying invested, indicating a collective bet on sustained value creation well beyond the listing event.

Long-Term Capital Gain refers to the profit earned from the sale of an asset held for a specified minimum period. In the case of listed equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds, a holding period of more than 12 months qualifies the gain as long-term. In India, LTCG on equity investments is currently taxed at 10% on gains exceeding₹1 lakh in a financial year, without the benefit of indexation.
This tax was reintroduced in the Union Budget of 2018, ending a long period during which long-term equity gains were exempt. The government at the time argued that the exemption created an imbalance between asset classes and led to revenue loss. While the₹1 lakh exemption was intended to protect small investors, critics argue that it does little to offset the broader impact on long-term wealth creation.
Investors and market stakeholders argue that LTCG discourages long-term investing by reducing post-tax returns, particularly for individuals who rely on equity markets for retirement planning and wealth accumulation. Over long holding periods, even a seemingly low tax rate can materially impact compounding, especially when indexation benefits are not allowed.
Another key concern is the issue of double taxation. Companies already pay corporate tax on profits, and dividends are taxed in the hands of shareholders. Taxing capital gains on top of this, investors argue, amounts to taxing the same income multiple times. Market participants say this reduces India’s competitiveness as an investment destination compared with jurisdictions that offer tax-efficient long-term equity frameworks.
Fund managers and market experts also point out that LTCG often leads to behavioural distortions. Investors tend to delay selling winning positions to avoid triggering tax, reducing liquidity and efficient price discovery. In volatile markets, the tax can discourage portfolio rebalancing, potentially increasing risk rather than reducing it.
Rajeev Gupta, Executive Vice President and Business Head – Third Party Products at Religare Broking Ltd, said India’s tax debate is at a critical juncture as the economy shifts from being saver-led to increasingly investor-driven. He noted that while the Union Budget 2025 was a landmark for the middle class — effectively making income up to₹12.75 lakh tax-free — the upcoming Union Budget 2026 must now confront what he described as an “aspiration drain”.
Gupta pointed out that India’s highest earners, those with annual income above₹2 crore, currently face an effective tax rate of nearly 39% to 43% after surcharges. According to him, such taxation levels risk pushing talent and capital out of the country, with entrepreneurs increasingly relocating to low-tax jurisdictions such as Dubai, where personal income tax is nil.
“Our highest earners are facing peak tax rates close to 40% or more, and that is no longer just a tax — it is becoming an exit trigger,” Gupta said, adding that rationalising surcharges and capping the effective tax rate at around 30% would help keep Indian capital anchored domestically.
On capital markets, Gupta flagged concerns around long-term taxation, arguing that the current 12.5% Long-Term Capital Gains tax has introduced unnecessary friction for investors. “Taxing inflationary gains discourages long-term compounding, which is essential if India wants to achieve its Viksit Bharat 2047 vision of a $30 trillion economy,” he said, urging policymakers to consider reverting to the earlier 10% LTCG regime.

The portfolio changes came against the backdrop of a sharp correction in smallcap stocks during 2025, prompting tactical realignments rather than wholesale exits.
Adcounty Media emerged as a fresh addition to Kacholia’s portfolio in the December quarter, with the investor picking up a 2.89% stake in the digital advertising solutions provider.
The company, which debuted on the BSE SME platform in July 2025, had a strong post-listing run and turned into a multibagger within just two months of listing. However, the rally proved unsustainable, with the stock now trading nearly 60% below its peak. It has shed 45% in 3 months and 2% in last 1 month.
Adcounty operates in the digital advertising space, offering performance-driven marketing solutions, a segment that has seen heightened competition but also long-term growth potential. The stake purchase indicates selective bottom-fishing rather than momentum chasing.
TechEra Engineering was the second new entrant in Kacholia’s portfolio during the quarter. According to Trendlyne data, he acquired a 4.98% stake, amounting to 7.98 lakh shares. The stock has declined 46% from its record high reached in October last year.
While the stock has gained 13% in last 1 year, it has been under pressure recently. It fell 15% in last 6 months, 34% in 3 months and 13% in past 1 month.
Kacholia increased his exposure to Gujarat Apollo during the December quarter by picking up an additional 1.2% stake, taking his total holding in the company to 2.3%, as per Trendlyne data. Gujarat Apollo manufactures heavy machinery used in mining, construction and road maintenance, with a strong focus on crushing and screening equipment.
The stock has lost 0.5% in last 1 year. However, it had lost 18% in 6 months, 14% in 3 months and 7.5% in 1 month. In the last 5 years, it has gained 71%.
The seasoned investor also marginally raised his holding in Knowledge Marine Engineering, increasing his stake by 0.1% to 2.9%. The company operates in the marine services space and is involved in dredging activities, besides running pilot boats, patrol vessels and survey boats.
In the last 1 year, the scrip has risen 50%, rallied 78% in 6 months, and 43% in 3 months. However, it fell 9% in past 1 month.
On the trimming side, Kacholia reduced his holding in Vasa Denticity by 0.5%, bringing his stake down to 3.5%. Vasa Denticity operates as a major B2B e-commerce platform for dental products in India, supplying a vast range of consumables, instruments and equipment to dentists, hospitals and clinics.
The stock has lost 14% in last 1 year, 2% in past 6 months ut gained 7% in last 1 month.
Kacholia also pared his stake in Walchandnagar Industries by 0.5%, leaving him with a 2.1% holding in the company. Walchandnagar Industries is a well-known heavy engineering firm engaged in high-tech manufacturing and project execution for critical sectors such as defence, aerospace, nuclear power and industrial machinery.
The stock has been under pressure recently. It lost 39% in last 1 year, 26% in last 6 months, 11% in past 3 months and 23% in past 1 month. However, in the last 5 years, it has given multibagger returns, soaring 134%.
Fineotex Chemicals appears to be a complete exit or a reduction below the 1% disclosure threshold. The stock has fallen nearly 70% over the past one year. Fineotex manufactures specialty performance chemicals and enzymes, with a strong presence in textiles and expanding exposure to segments such as home care, hygiene, water treatment, construction, leather, paints, agrochemicals and oil and gas.
The stock has been under pressure recently. It lost 36% in last 1 year, 21% in last 6 months, 12% in past 3 months and 11% in past 1 month. However, in the last 5 years, it has given multibagger returns, rallying 231%.

The Suwon, South Korea-based company has entered the final qualification phase with Nvidia, after supplying its initial samples to the US chipmaker in September, according to people familiar with the matter. Nvidia uses vast quantities of high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, to enable its AI accelerators.
Samsung is preparing for mass production of HBM4 in February, said the people, who asked not to be named as the information is private. The company will be ready to ship soon, though exact timing is not yet clear. Its shares gained as much as 3.2% in Seoul on Monday before paring gains, while SK Hynix’s stock slid by about the same amount.
Samsung trails SK Hynix and Micron Technology Inc. at the forefront of AI memory, but all three companies have seen their shares surge dramatically in recent weeks as the AI rush has produced a shortage of memory for the broader electronics industry. Between them, the three leading memory chip manufacturers have gained roughly $900 billion in market value since the start of September.
Investor hopes are now rising that Samsung may be able to join its rivals in supplying components for Nvidia’s upcoming flagship Rubin processors. So far, Nvidia has leaned most heavily on SK Hynix for the most sophisticated memory chips it pairs with its top-of-the-line AI accelerators.
The Korea Economic Daily reported earlier Samsung is slated to begin HBM4 shipments to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. next month. Both Samsung and SK Hynix are slated to hold their earnings calls on Thursday, and they are expected to discuss progress on their HBM4 chips.

The move reflects how the government's rail financier, which has nearly $8 billion in overseas exposure, is responding to currency volatility even as it reshapes its business beyond funding the Indian Railways.
Nearly 70% of IRFC’s forex loans are dollar-denominated and a 6% fall in the Indian rupee against the US currency over the last 12 months has prompted the company to explore these steps, chairman and managing director Manoj Kumar Dubey toldMint.
“My exposure is nearly $8 billion… Of this, nearly 30% is yen-denominated and 70% is in dollars,"" Dubey said in an interview.
“We are exploring whether some part of the dollar book can be swapped into Swiss franc because the cost there is much lower,"" Dubey said. ""If something comes out and plans materialize, maybe we will be looking at nearly a $1 billion conversion.""
The cost of dollar-denominated borrowings is now touching 8%, he said, adding that the number was earlier around 7%, he said.
Dubey clarified that the idea is not to eliminate foreign currency loans, but to rebalance the liability mix, so that IRFC is less exposed to dollar-rupee volatility.
“We don't want to be overtly dependent on one currency. The effort is to diversify our currency exposure, so that sharp movements in the dollar do not hurt us,"" the chairman said.
The outcome of such a rejig in the currency mix may, however, not necessarily be positive for the company.
“Currency selection to reduce interest cost can have unpredictable outcomes. In the past, the INR has depreciated more against Swiss franc as compared to the US dollar,"" said Kuljit Singh, partner and national infrastructure leader at EY India, a consultancy major. ""Further, there is a general perception that USD (dollar) may weaken in future, which may create further unintended surprises in interest cost for Indian borrowers looking to switch currencies.""
IRFC is working on a co-lending structure with multilateral agencies, Dubey said, without sharing the names.
Metro rail projects have so far relied mainly on multilateral agencies and foreign currency loans, he said. “If a PPP (public-private partnerships) metro line is to be taken over by the state government, they either go to a bilateral agency or they look for some domestic (funding option). We want to say we are here. We are open to it (funding),"" Dubey said.
Government guarantees will be needed for this, as metro systems are not profitable, the chairman said.
The financier is already on a co-lending structure with multilateral agencies. “We will fund the rolling stock part… and multilaterals will take care of the infra part,"" he said.
The template for this strategy is the refinancing of the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corp. of India Ltd (DFCCIL). “We did one big refinancing of nearly₹10,000 crore,"" he said. DFCCIL replaced a dollar loan with a rupee loan from IRFC, saving₹2,700 crore over the loan tenure.
Diversification driveFor decades, IRFC existed only to fund the Indian Railways. That changed after the government began funding railway capex directly. “In FY24, (we had) zero disbursements to the Indian Railways… In FY25 also, there was almost no disbursement.""IRFC's diversification drive took off in FY25, with the company tapping into railway-linked projects across other public sector undertakings and subsequently expanding into financing power generation (genco) projects with rail linkages.It recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authorityfor funding its upcoming Vadhavan Port, off-Mumbai. IRFC's clientele includes NTPC, Gaiil, among others.IRFC expects its earnings to improve as it moves to non-railway project funding.The company earlier operated under a cost-plus model, earning 40 basis points on rolling stock and 35 basis points on project finance, which effectively capped its profitability. This meant if the company financed₹1,000 crore of rolling stock, it would earn only 0.4%, or₹4 crore, no matter how efficiently the project performed. “Now, in the diversified book, returns are much higher. Here, we are seated to make a margin of 100-150 basis points,"" Dubey said.IRFC's overall borrowing cost is 15–25 bps lower than its peers, Dubey said.The company has a loan disbursement target of₹30,000 crore for FY26 and for the “next few years"", said the chairman. In April-December, the first nine months of this fiscal year, IRFC has disbursed₹22,000 crore. The company's assets under management (AUM) were at₹4.75 lakh crore at the end of December, having risen₹15,000 crore in the December quarter alone.

The $944 million Fidelity Funds Pacific Fund, run by Dale Nicholls, has about 23% of its investments in Japanese stocks, the most for any country. It’s beaten 96% of its peers in the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One of its top holdings is Fujibo Holdings Inc., which makes polishing pads needed for chip devices and the company’s shares have risen twice as fast as the benchmark Topix index in the past year.
“Japan is always a great stock-picking market,” Nicholls said in an interview. “If you look into it, there are many names in the tech space, particularly at the smaller end. I still think their competitiveness is under-appreciated.”
Huge global demand for artificial intelligence has resulted in surging share prices of memory chipmakers whose products power the AI boom, like Sandisk Corp. in the US and Samsung Electronics Co. in South Korea. That’s made them relatively expensive, opening the way for less pricey stocks of smaller firms like Fujibo who have businesses that are essential for AI.
Fujibo, which got its start as a cotton spinning company in 1896, now generates around 45% of its revenue from its polishing materials business. Its polishing pads are used for items such as LCD glass needed for smartphones, hard disks and silicon wafers for semiconductor products.
The Tokyo-based company has soared 80% over the past year, exceeding the Topix’s 32% gain and the 39% advance in the Topix gauge for small companies. Yet Fujibo’s price-earnings ratio trades at about 20 times, just slightly higher than companies in the Topix index, and still lower than the Nikkei 225’s P/E of 23 times, indicating it may have scope to rise more.
While Japan’s chip device makers aren’t the biggest in the world, “you’ve still got strong market positions in parts of the supply chain that are very critical,” said Nicholls, who joined Fidelity in 1996. He’s expecting further gains in small-cap companies that are benefiting from emerging AI-related businesses.
Generally, smaller shares pose higher risks for investors than large caps, because they tend to be more volatile and lower liquidity can make it harder to conduct big sell orders when needed.
Indeed, Nicholls’ ten largest share holdings are led by industry giants Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. Still, he sees opportunity in smaller names.
“I do think there’s room to increase weightings there,” he said. “I’ll say that I’m increasingly finding more opportunity in Japan amongst the smaller caps, particularly in growth areas.”

In October-December, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys reported three mega deals combined, the most in nine quarters, according to their earnings filings. These involve deploying artificial intelligence (AI) tools to transform clients’ legacy information technology (IT) infrastructure.
Yet, Fortune companies are reducing the number of IT vendors they work with to reduce their long-term software services costs, analysts say.
The spike in large contracts points to how AI is reshaping the software services sector even as homegrown offshorers grapple with low demand amid global trade uncertainty and stricter visa scrutiny in the US, their largest market.
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) secured a mega deal from a North American financial institution in the December quarter, the company said during its post-earnings analyst call. The company didn’t disclose the client’s name.
In October, India’s second-largest IT firm Infosys Ltd won a 15-year IT modernization contract worth $1.6 billion with the NHS, the UK’s national healthcare provider.
Earlier, Cognizant bagged two mega deals in the April-June 2025 period: one IT infrastructure contract from UnitedHealth Group spanning an average of five years, and another deal from an unnamed client. Mid-sized software services firm Coforge Ltd also clinched a $1.56 billion contract, its largest, in March last year.
“Most of these mega deals are increasing because IT vendors are going after consolidation deals,"" said Ashutosh Sharma, vice-president, research director at Forrester. “They are promising more productivity by lowering their pricing to transform the clients’ IT infrastructure. This way, they are in turn trying to grab more revenue share.""
Sharma expects margins to continue shrinking across the board. “Traditional IT services like coding, application management, and call centre support will shrink in margins. These will be offset by new services led by AI platforms that are not low in margin.""
The last time the companies won more mega deals was in the July-September 2023 period–one each by TCS and HCL Tech, and two by Infosys.
The recent surge in such deals followed a lull in 2024, and came amid uncertainty over US tariffs and geopolitical tensions in 2025. The last big-ticket contract came in January 2024 when TCS won a $2.5 billion, 15-year IT modernization deal from Aviva.
HCLTech reported advanced AI revenue of $146 million, up 19.9% sequentially in constant currency terms, in the December quarter. Advanced AI includes Agentic AI, physical AI, robotics, and large-scale data-centre. Constant-currency numbers do not factor in exchange rate fluctuations.
“We see the innovate-to-build cycle accelerating sharply, with over three times more rapid builds that we delivered for our customers this quarter,"" said Aarthi Subramanian, chief operating officer of TCS, during the company’s post-earnings analyst call on 12 January.
TCS ended last year with $1.8 billion in annualised AI revenue and Gen AI is its fastest-growing vertical, with 17.3% quarterly growth in constant currency.
Subramanian outlined a two-pronged AI strategy: “First, ‘Get AI ready’: Partner with them to build a strong enterprise technology foundation required for their AI transformation. Secondly, ‘Lead with AI’: Engage with business and technology teams to help them establish early competitive advantage in AI.""
However, Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of research firm Everest Group, called these contracts vendor-consolidation deals, citing that “we have yet to see a large amount of work driven by AI transformation"".
“The industry talks a lot about AI and signing work related to it. However, most of this work is about applying AI to their code generation, not using AI to transform their customers' business,"" he said. “It’s true there is some of this work, but it is small in comparison to the bulk of what they are doing.""
IT firms have also been facing questions about profitability and margins since the previous deal surge in 2023.
The last spike in mega deals saw Infosys bag an IT modernization project worth $1.6 billion with Liberty Global in August 2023. Around the same time, HCLTech won a $2.1 billion managed services contract from Verizon. TCS got a $1 billion contract from Jaguar Land Rover in September 2023, whereas Infosys bagged a $1.5 billion deal with an unnamed global client.
Telecom companies awarded four mega deals to IT outsourcers over the past three years, while healthcare and life sciences companies were the second-largest spenders.
Yet, analysts flagged concerns about TCS’s “thin"" margins from the BSNL deal, while also questioning Infosys and HCLTech about upfront costs due to the ramp-up in mega contracts. IT vendors generally have to invest in talent, infrastructure, and IT hardware at the beginning of such projects, inflating one-time costs and reducing margins.
Infosys’s margins narrowed by 30 basis points to 20.7% in FY24. While HCLTech’s operating margins were unchanged at 18.2% for that fiscal. TCS reported an improvement of 50 basis points to 24.6%. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.

The CEOs of companies including Target, Best Buy, Land O’Lakes, Cargill, General Mills, UnitedHealth Group as well as professional sports teams such as the Minnesota Vikings and the Minnesota Timberwolves were among the signatories of the letter shared Sunday by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce.
“For the past several weeks, representatives of Minnesota’s business community have been working every day behind the scenes with federal, state and local officials to advance real solutions,” the letter said. “With yesterday’s tragic news, we are calling for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together.”
The letter came after Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, on Saturday after he was subdued and on his hands and knees. He had a permit to carry a weapon, which the agents found on him before the killing.
Earlier this month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, as she was driving away. Federal agents are in Minneapolis as part of President Donald Trump’s immigrant crackdown.
Hours after the shooting, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino claimed, without presenting evidence, that Pretti had impeded and assaulted the federal officers in what they claimed was an act of domestic terrorism.
The agents involved in Pretti’s killing were “most likely” being placed on administrative leave and sent from Minneapolis, Bovino said Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union. He reiterated his defense of Border Patrol officers’ actions as justified.
State and city officials repeated their calls for the federal officers to leave and demanded that Minnesota’s authorities take over the investigation into Pretti’s death.
Bovino said the immigrant that agents were seeking when they grabbed Pretti remains at large. Walz accused the agents of engaging in “extra-judicial law enforcement” rather than focusing on immigration enforcement.
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told reporters Sunday that he was “deeply concerned” about the preservation of evidence on Pretti’s shooting after state investigators were denied access to the crime scene.
Ellison said state officials and sought and received a restraining order requiring federal officials to preserve evidence.
“At this point in time, I’m just asking try for a moment to set aside the political side of it and go back and ground in the humanity of this,” Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said at the conference. “This family has gone through enough and to have the most powerful man in the world drag their dead son with absolutely no evidence, and gaslight the entire country, this is enough.”

Discovery (WBD). Although the final vote remains in the hands of WBD shareholders, both companies are making efforts to persuade their decision with adjustments to their original bids.
2. Per-share offer:Netflix's offer gives the shareholders a $27.75 per share all-cash offer, and Paramount's bid offers shareholders $30 apiece all-cash tender offer.
4. Closing:Netflix's offer closes between 12 and 18 months, while Paramount's offer stands for more than 12 months.
5. CEOs:Netflix's deal is led by co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, while Paramount Skydance's deal is led by CEO David Ellison.
6. Who will fund?Netflix's offer will be funded through a debt funding route of up to $59 billion from Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, and HSBC Bank, along with cash on hand and equity.
7. Enterprise value:Netflix's offer comes with an enterprise value of $82.7 billion and an equity value of $72 billion. While, Paramount's offer comes with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion and an equity value of $74.35 billion.
8. Breakup fee:In Netflix's bid, the company will pay $5.8 billion, and Warner Bros. will have to pay $2.8 billion. While Paramount's offer will make the company pay $5.8 billion as a breakup fee.
9. Streaming subscribers:Netflix has a subscriber base of over 300 million, while Paramount has 79.1 million.
In Paramount's bid, all of Warner Bros Discovery, including film, television, streaming, gaming and cable television networks, including HBO and CNN, are in line for a takeover.
In an SEC filing on 20 January 2026, Netflix revised its original offer structure of the $82.7 billion acquisition deal, from a combination of cash and equity shares to an all-cash deal in an effort to make it simpler.
Despite making the change in the structure to an all-cash deal, Netflix continues to value the Warner Bros. acquisition at $27.75 per share, unchanged from the prior transaction structure.
This move comes as Netflix aims to simplify the transaction structure, while providing greater certainty for WBD stockholders in value terms, and to also expedite the path to a WBD stockholder vote on the offer.
Competing against Netflix, in an effort of a hostile takeover, Paramount Skydance bid $108 billion, looking to potentially acquire Warner Bros. Discovery via an all-cash deal.
Mintreported earlier how the company offered $30 per share to WBD investors to potentially acquire all the outstanding shares.
In efforts to make the deal lucrative for the shareholders, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison's father and Oracle's Founder and billionaire Larry Ellison have agreed to personally fund $40.4 billion in equity financing to support Paramount Skydance’s all-cash offer.
However, in a recent interview with theFinancial Times, Netflix CEO Greg Peters said that without Larry Ellison's financial support through independent financing, there is allegedly no chance for Paramount to pull off the funding for the acquisition round.
Now all eyes are on the upcoming shareholders meeting of Warner Bros. Discovery, where the people will vote on the proposed transactions which is expected to be held by April 2026, on whether or not to accept the acquisition offer.

""India's private credit market is booming,"" Manisha Girotra, chief executive of Moelis India, toldMint.
Since private credit is more flexible on the cap table, it can be structured to reflect individual risk appetites, she said.
Girotra's bullishness on the private credit market can also be attributed to the fact that in India, private credit yields typically range from 14% to 22%. This is substantially higher than the average yield of 8% to 10% for banks and 10% to 13% for finance companies in India, according to S&P Global's 2025 report.
""These private credit players are offering real, huge flexibility,"" Girotra said, pointing to the example of Adani Airports Holdings Ltd.
When Adani's Mumbai International Airport first raised private credit in 2021 as a greenfield project, options were limited.
Four years later, as the project neared operation, it refinanced the $750 million debt facility for a second time with private credit lenders led by Apollo-managed funds.
Then, in June 2025, private equity giant KKR & Co. provided $600 million in financing to Ranjan Pai's Manipal group, marking the American firm's largest private credit investment in India. The capital was anchored by KKR's private credit and insurance platforms.
Private credit's competitive pricing has enabled it to establish a foothold in India's longer-term and higher-quality infrastructure assets, Girotra explained.
But Girotra remains bullish on private credit and expects its share of borrowings to rise. ""I think you'll see it play a much larger role going forward,"" she said.
Prior to joining the India arm of New York-based Moelis & Co., Girotra was CEO and country head of UBS in India, where she managed its investment bank, commercial bank, markets, equity research and wealth management divisions. Before that, she was the head of Barclays Bank's north India business.
She highlighted how, over the last few years, investment bankers have noticed heightened competition between private capital and public markets.
""What makes our lives more challenging now is the fact that private capital is competing with public markets. With the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) that happened last year, and the valuation that public markets are offering, private equity [instead of credit] has had to become more competitive.""
India's IPO market was one of the hottest global destinations in 2025, with over 350 companies raising more than₹1.75 trillion. With increased competition between public markets and private equity, Girotra expects some amount of dual-tracking to also play out in the Indian deals ecosystem.
A dual-track process is a strategic path a company follows to raise funds when it is unsure of which way to go.
Girotra cited Manjushree Technopak's example from late 2024, where Advent International sold its portfolio firm to PAG after pursuing a dual-track strategy.
Minthad also reported in February 2025 that ITC had mulled acquiring Orkla India for $1.4 billion, seen as a pivot from the MNC's plans for its India listings.
Renewables, AI And Healthcare BetGirotra said that the 2026 deals environment will likely see heightened activity in the renewables and artificial intelligence spaces, including data centres.Industry analysts believe that India’s data centre capacity will grow fivefold by 2030 to over 8GW, from current levels of around 1GW, according to a KPMG report from December 2025. This growth is expected to generate capital expenditure of over $30 billion.This growth in the sector will ensure that buyers and PE-backed platforms continue to pursue targets in data platforms, AI-related infrastructure, and renewable power sources to feed these assets, Girotra said.She also said that India will see significant activity in the coming months in sectors where the domestic consumer is the end user, such as healthcare services.""The urban middle class is rising, and rural India is doing well again. So naturally, everyone wants to play to that market, and that is where the M&A appetite is going to be enormous,"" she explained.The consumer healthcare space is currently ‘on fire’ with deals like Manipal's $760 million acquisition of Sahyadri Hospitals and Torrent Pharma's acquisition of a controlling stake in JB Chemicals from KKR, she said.Overall, in 2025, investment in India's pharma sector stood at $8.3 billion across M&A and PE/VC deals, with public markets adding another $1.5 billion through IPOs and $1.2 billion through Qualified Institutional Placements (QIPs), according to Grant Thornton Bharat data.PE firms will continue to invest in single speciality formats, either directly or in platform mode, with focus on oncology, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), mother and child care, dialysis and eyecare, Grant Thornton added.But healthcare, Girotra said, is just one of the many sectors that will play out.""While the government has taken a ‘leapfrog’ lead in infrastructure that private corporates haven't traditionally matched, other areas like semiconductors, rare earth minerals, cement, and paints are also going to see a lot of excitement,"" she said without giving details.Key TakeawaysDespite representing only 1.2% of corporate lending, private credit is becoming a preferred tool for complex M&A transactions due to its flexibility in structuring.Private credit offers yields of 14-22%, far outpacing traditional banking and attracting global giants like KKR and Apollo.High public market valuations are forcing companies to run IPO and M&A processes in parallel to secure the best exit.Data centre capacity is set to grow 5x by 2030, requiring $30 billion in capex and driving significant M&A.Healthcare, renewables, semiconductors, and consumer-facing services are identified as the primary deal drivers for 2026.
Girotra said that the 2026 deals environment will likely see heightened activity in the renewables and artificial intelligence spaces, including data centres.

According to an official statement, the ED’s Bengaluru zonal office filed the prosecution complaint on January 23 before a local court designated to try cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
WinZO, through its mobile application, offered more than 100 games with a claimed user base of about 25 crore users, largely from tier-3 and tier-4 cities, the ED said.
""For providing these RMG (real money gaming) services, the company charged a percentage of the betting amounts from the users, as commission. The company also assured its users that its gaming platform was free from any BOTs (bots which are computer-controlled characters), was transparent and secure,"" the central agency added.
Analysis of the game codebases, third-party developer agreements and internal communications shows that till December 2023, the RMGs were ""embedded"" with BOTs, AI and algorithm profiles.
From May 2024 to August 2025, Winzo changed its code-based BOT modus operandi to simulate historical match-play data of dormant, inactive players against real users without their knowledge or consent, the ED claimed.
""To suppress and conceal these unscrupulous acts, the company deliberately referred to the use of BOTs and simulated players under misleading terminologies such as EP (engagement play), PPP (past performance of player) and Persona,"" it said.
The agency further said it found that users were initially ""lured"" with small bonuses and made to win against easy BOTs, while also being allowed to withdraw small winnings in order to create a ""false"" sense of trust.
Once the users began playing with higher boot amounts, hard BOTs were deployed systematically, resulting in ""significant"" financial losses to the users. The genuine users lost to BOT profiles and ""incurred loss"" of about₹734 crore, it said.
""Genuine winnings at higher stakes were often blocked through restrictive withdrawal mechanisms, forcing them (users) into continued gameplay,"" the ED alleged.
The central agency charged that WinZO ""failed"" to return legitimate user winnings and deposits worth₹47.66 crore, even after RMGs were banned by the central government last year.
In this manner, the company generated proceeds of crime to the tune of₹3,522.05 crore between 2021-2022 and 2025-2026 financial years (as on Aug 22, 2025), it said.
It also alleged that proceeds of crime generated by the company were laundered through shell companies created in the US and Singapore.
The ED had conducted raids at the premises of WinZO and its promoters last year and had arrested Nanda and Rathore. Rathore is now out on bail.

Discovery (WBD), calling out that the offer being backed by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who is set to fund $40.4 billion in equity financing, reported the news portalFinancial Times (FT).
“Without Larry Ellison independently financing this thing, there’s no chance in hell Paramount would ever be able to pull this off,” Peters told the news portal.
The executive also called Paramount's offer “pretty crazy”, citing the rising debts of the rival and its need to finance its $30-per-share offer.
He also claimed that a “very small” number of Warner Bros. shareholders have been in support of Paramount's hostile buyout offer for the entire company, according to the news portal's report.
In its filing, the company said that Paramount's offer remains ‘inadequate, particularly given the insufficient value it would provide.’ The board also claimed that there is a “lack of certainty” in the company's ability to fulfil the offer, creating risk and costs for the shareholders.
“The board unanimously determined that the Paramount’s latest offer remains inferior to our merger agreement with Netflix across multiple key areas,” Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chairperson of Warner Bros. Discovery board, told the shareholders.
The transaction continues to be valued at $27.75 per share of Warner Bros. Discovery shares, unchanged from the previous transaction structure. However, the only change has been that a deal which was previously set to be a combination of cash and equity will now only be an all-cash agreement.
In an interview with the news portalFT, Netflix CEO Greg Peters said the company is expecting to win the backing of the shareholders, adding that Paramount's offer “doesn’t pass the sniff test.”
As the world awaits shareholders' decision in April 2026, Netflix is seeking to win over any wavering Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders. The CEO also said that the revised offer issued earlier this month provides “greater deal certainty”, which is partly funded by $55 billion of debt and also reportedly provides a snapshot in Netflix's strong balance sheet for the potential all-cash deal.

The higher target comes as the company emerges from a period of weak steel prices and margin pressure, even as it steps up efforts to secure raw materials and looks for early signs of a recovery in demand.
The 56 mtpa target excludes the company’s recently inked joint venture with Japan's JFE Steel Corp., under which JSW sold half its stake in subsidiary Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL). Including BPSL, the company was likely to top 60 mtpa by FY31, said Jayant Acharya, joint managing director and chief executive officer, in an interview withMint.

Including BPSL, the company was likely to top 60 mtpa by FY31, said Jayant Acharya, joint managing director and chief executive officer, in an interview with Mint.
“So we expect to be—without the expansion of the BPSL joint venture—at 56 million tonnes by the end of (FY) 2031,"" Acharya said. Out of that 1.5 mtpa will be in the US, while the remaining 54.5 mtpa will be in India.
In addition, the management sees further upside from BPSL, where capacity could potentially be expanded to 10 million tonnes from the current 4.5 million tonnes, although this will be pursued independently by the joint venture partners. “That will be a parallel track which the joint venture partners will decide and then take on,"" Acharya said.
The company has also charted a plan to spend₹1 trillion over the next four to five years for capacity expansion.
“We will give you a break-up year-wise in our annual (and) fourth (quarter) results in May, but roughly four to five years, you can spread it equally. It will be a little higher in the next year, next two years, and then slowly go down,"" Acharya told analysts Friday evening during a post Q3 earnings interaction.
Alongside capacity growth, JSW Steel is stepping up efforts to secure raw materials. Acharya said the company expects to meet around 50% of its iron ore requirement from captive mines by FY31, supported by 23 operating mines across multiple states.
On coking coal, the company is targeting 25% captive sourcing, which could rise to 33-35% once it completes the acquisition of a potential coking coal mine in Mozambique.
Looking ahead, after multi-year low steel prices and higher input costs weighed on earnings, Acharya said the current quarter is showing signs of recovery.
“I think probably now with the rupee depreciation as well as some improvement in the domestic demand, I think the prices will come to more reasonable levels during this quarter,"" the chief executive said. While he could not give guidance on the extent of price rises, he said higher coking coal costs will also lead to an increase in prices.
""We estimate an impact of $15-20 per tonne from higher coking coal price in the current quarter, which we expect to mitigate through pricing and cost measures,"" he said.
JSW Steel reported a consolidated net profit of₹2,139 crore for the quarter ended 31 December 2025, up from₹717 crore a year ago. The profit beat the₹1,406.7 crore consensus estimate of 13 analysts polled byBloomberg.
The Mumbai-headquartered steelmaker reported an 11% year-on-year jump in revenue from operations to₹45,991 crore. Adjusted Ebitda rose 22% on year to₹6,620 crore, with an Ebitda margin of 14.4%.
For the December quarter, profit was boosted by a one-time deferred tax asset recognition of₹1,439 crore linked to BPSL and an exceptional employee-related provision of₹529 crore arising from changes in labour codes.
Excluding these items, profitability was lower sequentially due to weaker realisations and higher coal costs, although value-added products helped cushion the impact, Acharya added.
The adjusted Ebitda excludes unrealized forex gains and losses on long-term borrowings, net of unrealised forex gains and losses on intercompany receivables.
Regulatory scrutinyOn allegations of price collusion reported in the media, Acharya said he does not see any merit in the case and that JSW Steel remains compliant with competition laws.“JSW Steel remains fully confident in its compliance with all the applicable competition laws and the laws of the land,"" he said, adding that the product in question—the TMT market—is highly price-sensitive and dominated by secondary players.Earlier this month, India’s competition watchdog found that market leaders JSW Steel, Tata Steel, state-run SAIL and 25 other firms colluded on steel selling prices, according to aReutersreport citing a confidential document, potentially exposing the companies and their executives to hefty fines.

The company has challenged a 3 December 2025 order of the Kerala High Court, which refused to stay the CCI’s investigation and directed the regulator to complete the probe within eight weeks.
A bench led by Justice J.B. Pardiwala is set to hear JioStar’s appeal on Tuesday, 27 January.
The case arises from a complaint by Asianet Digital Network, a major cable and TV distributor in Kerala. Asianet alleged that JioStar is dominant in the state because it controls several popular Malayalam entertainment channels and holds exclusive rights to major sporting events such as the IPL and international cricket.
Under the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) rules, broadcasters are allowed to give discounts only up to 35% and must follow a non-discriminatory pricing regime. However, Asianet alleged that JioStar effectively gave KCCL discounts of more than 50% by routing money through separate marketing or promotional agreements.
According to Asianet, these marketing arrangements were a sham used to return money to KCCL, giving it much lower effective channel prices. This cost advantage allegedly allowed KCCL to offer cheaper packages, attract subscribers and local cable operators, and gain market share, while Asianet was forced to pay higher prices for the same content.
After examining the complaint, the CCI in February 2022 found a prima facie case and ordered its director general to conduct a detailed investigation. The regulator clarified that this was only a preliminary step and did not amount to any finding of guilt against JioStar.
JioStar challenged the CCI’s order before the high court mainly on jurisdictional grounds, arguing that the dispute relates to pricing and contractual issues governed by the Trai Act and the 2017 Broadcasting Regulations.
Since disputes between broadcasters and distributors fall within the jurisdiction of regulator Trai and the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, JioStar said the CCI should not have intervened. The company also accused Asianet of forum shopping by bypassing the telecom regulator.
In May 2025, a single judge of the Kerala High Court upheld the CCI’s order to investigate, holding that competition law can apply alongside sectoral regulation and that Trai’s presence does not bar a probe into alleged abuse of dominance and discriminatory pricing.
The court said the CCI’s direction was only a preliminary step and that JioStar could raise all its objections before the regulator during the inquiry.
JioStar’s appeal was later dismissed by a division bench of the Kerala High Court on 3 December 2025, which agreed with the single judge and allowed the CCI’s investigation in the Kerala market to continue. This led JioStar to approach the Supreme Court.
JioStar was formed in November 2024 after Reliance Industries merged its media business with The Walt Disney Company’s India operations in a deal valued at about $8.5 billion.
According to JustWatch data for the April-June quarter of 2025, JioStar’s streaming platform JioHotstar led India’s subscription video-on-demand market with around a 25% share. Amazon Prime Video followed with about 23%, Netflix with 19%, Apple TV+ with roughly 14%, ZEE5 with 10% and Sony LIV with 5%. Other platforms together accounted for the remaining 4%.

Anil Taparia, chief operating officer (COO) at ACME Green Hydrogen and Ammonia Business Unit, said in an interview that the agreement for the greenfield plant has been inked with Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation of Odisha Ltd (IPICOL).
ACME is in talks with several global shipping lines to sign offtake agreements, with the green methanol project to be commissioned by 2029-30.
The European Union's FuelEU Maritime Regulation and the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) call for net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in global shipping by 2050.
Green methanol, green ammonia, and green hydrogen are considered sustainable green fuel options in the shipping industry. Green ammonia is produced from green hydrogen and nitrogen via the Haber-Bosch process, and green methanol is made by combining green hydrogen with captured carbon dioxide, according to The Energy Research Institute (Teri).
By 2030, the global green methanol market is expected to be driven primarily by shipping decarbonisation, with maritime demand estimated at 5–10 million tonnes per annum. According to industry estimates, Europe is expected to account for around 40–50% of import demand, with additional interest from hubs in Singapore, Japan, and South Korea.
Given global demand projections, the government is looking to develop India as an export hub for green hydrogen and its derivatives, including green methanol, backed by large-scale renewable capacity, port access, and policy support under the National Green Hydrogen Mission.
Taparia added that the abundant availability of biogenic feedstock, supportive industrial policies, and a low-cost green power supply have created a robust ecosystem in Odisha for the production of green methanol at globally competitive costs. He also said that the project would be funded through debt, internal accruals, with an equity fund raise also on the agenda, but no final decision has been taken yet.
""Discussions with several global financial institutions are underway. IPICOL will largely play the role of a facilitator for the project,"" he said.
ACME Group has already set up a small-scale green ammonia project in Bikaner, Rajasthan. It is also developing a 0.1 million metric tonne per annum (MMTPA) green ammonia project in Duqm, Oman. By 2032, it aims to build a 10 MMTPA portfolio of green ammonia or equivalent green hydrogen.
ACME has received six letters of award (LoAs) from Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) under the first tranche of the scheme for the supply of green ammonia to India’s fertilizer sector. Under the LoAs, ACME Group will supply 370,000 tonnes per year of green ammonia to some of India’s largest chemicals and fertiliser companies for 10 years.
The maritime sector is expected to be the primary sector requiring green methanol. Under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, Shipping Corporation of India is working to retrofit a few ships to run on green methanol, green hydrogen, or other derivatives by 2027.
According to Teri’s November 2024 report on green hydrogen, the choice between fuel cells and internal combustion engines depends on vessel type and operational requirements. Two broad categories of shipping, short-distance and long-distance, demand different technological solutions. “Short-distance shipping takes place on routes between nearby ports. The relatively shorter distances allow the use of cleaner energy, electric propulsion, and biogas,"" the report said.
While noting that hydrogen-powered engines for shipping are also under development, green ammonia and green methanol are currently more favourable options, as they can provide the required energy for long routes, the report said.

That claim, however, has come into question with a new lawsuit where an international group of plaintiffs has sued the company, alleging that it made false claims about the privacy and security of WhatsApp.
The lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court in San Francisco on Friday, alleges that Meta's privacy claims are false, according to a Bloomberg report. The plaintiffs argue that Meta and WhatsApp can “store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”.
The plaintiffs argue that Meta can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications. They also accused the company and its leaders of defrauding WhatsApp's billions of users worldwide.
The lawyers for the plaintiffs have requested the court to certify a class-action lawsuit.
Meanwhile, a Meta spokesperson, while reacting to the lawsuit to Bloomberg, called it “frivolous” while noting that the company will “pursue sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel.”
Notably, Meta had also been sued in September last year by its former head of security Attaullah Baig who alleged that WhatsApp contained “systemic cybersecurity failures” that could potentially compromise user privacy.
Baig had also claimed that he discovered that approximately 1,500 WhatsApp engineers had unrestricted access to user data, including sensitive personal information. He also stated that employees “could move or steal such data without detection or audit trail.”
Meta had also drawn backlash last year after the company announced its plans to show hyperpersonalized ads to users based on their conversations with the Meta AI chatbot across WhatsApp, Instagram and its other apps. Meanwhile, the company has also begun showing ads to users on the status update on WhatsApp.
In India, Meta had been fined₹213.14 crore over the company's 2021 policy which forced users to share data with other Meta apps like Facebook and Instagram for advertising purposes.

Meta has made so called “end-to-end” encryption a central part of WhatsApp’s feature set, offering a kind of encryption that means a message is only accessible to the sender and recipient, but not the company.
In this kind of encrypted chat, which the company says is turned on by default, WhatsApp’s in-app messaging says “only people in this chat can read, listen to, or share” the messages.
In the lawsuit filed Friday in US District Court in San Francisco, the group of plaintiffs allege that Meta’s privacy claims are false. They allege that Meta and WhatsApp “store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications” — and accuse the companies and their leaders of defrauding WhatsApp’s billions of users worldwide.
A spokesperson for Meta, which acquired WhatsApp in 2014, called the lawsuit “frivolous” and said that the company “will pursue sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel.”
“Any claim that people’s WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false and absurd,” spokesperson Andy Stone said in an email. “WhatsApp has been end-to-end encrypted using the Signal protocol for a decade. This lawsuit is a frivolous work of fiction.”
The group, which includes plaintiffs from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa, alleges that Meta stores the substance of users’ communications and that workers can get access to them.
The complaint cites “whistleblowers” as having helped bring this information to light, though it doesn’t explain who they are.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs are asking the court to certify a class-action suit. Multiple attorneys listed in the suit from the firms of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Keller Postman didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Another one of the plaintiff’s lawyers, Jay Barnett, from Barnett Legal, declined to comment Saturday night.

The grants were suspended to evaluate whether activities were in “alignment with administration and agency priorities,” according to an email viewed by Bloomberg News.
The temporary pause was for HHS to implement a new review process and to “ensure funds are used for their intended purposes,” said Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the agency. He said that states would be notified that the pause had been lifted.
The sudden change is similar to the turnabout earlier this month when the Trump administration notified behavioral health organizations that it was terminating $2 billion in grants because their federal awards did not align with the priorities at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Under pressure from medical groups and lawmakers, the administration reversed its decision days later.
The bulk of federal grants to state and local public health agencies are awarded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over a five-year period to help departments with their workforces and data modernization. The funding is also used to support diversity and health equity programs, according to the public health infrastructure grant website.
News of the state and local health funding pause was met with frustration. “It’s another senseless disruption when we are trying to provide public health services,” said Phil Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services. Dallas is facing $2.1 million in grant losses that supported disease investigations, surveillance systems and vaccine management programs, he said.
The Public Health Infrastructure Grants were first awarded to states in fall 2022.
Other recipients include the Association of State and Territorial Health offices, the National Network of Public Health Institutes and the Public Health Accreditation Board. The work from these partners supports 107 health departments to provide technical assistance.
The CDC has been hit with widespread staff layoffs and funding cuts since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. started his role in the top post.

Some employees told the news portal that the survey aimed to raise awareness of energy conservation and the efficient use of electricity.
Infosys has also encouraged employees to implement energy-saving practices at home, noting that its buildings use 50-60% less electricity than traditional ones. The questions inquire about the usage of electrical appliances, fans, air conditioners, heaters, and the wattage of lights, as well as whether employees use solar power at home, the report said.
In 2020-21, Infosys was among the first companies to estimate and report emissions from remote work. This was done through a survey measuring electricity use for lighting, fans, computers, air conditioning, and other related activities, it added.

This regulatory intervention followed a period of extensive operational instability.
Airport slots represent specific time intervals granted to carriers for arrivals and departures at high-traffic airfields. These allocations are vital for the synchronization of flight timings and overall logistical effectiveness.
IndiGo has provided the Ministry of Civil Aviation with a comprehensive list of more than 700 vacated slots, which were abandoned after the winter domestic schedule was officially truncated late last year, the reportANIsaid.
In response, the ministry has invited other airlines to submit requests for operating domestic flights on these newly available slots, the report added.
Regarding the reallocation of these windows, the Ministry intends to ensure that the surrendered capacity does not sit idle. Priority will be directed toward competing airlines that can prove genuine resource availability — including extra aircraft, flight crews, ground handling gear, and technical engineers — rather than those simply moving around current flight paths.
According to Ministry guidelines, carriers are required to provide proof of operational readiness; otherwise, any granted slots will be revoked.
Furthermore, airlines are prohibited from cutting existing routes or connectivity just to take advantage of the newly available slots.
The DGCA’s restrictive measures were a response to severe passenger dissatisfaction triggered by delays and cancellations during the early winter months. The regulator's strategy aims to forestall further volatility and mandate stricter schedule compliance.
Between December 3 and 5 last year, IndiGo cancelled 2,507 flights and 1,852 flights were delayed, impacting over 3 lakh passengers at airports across the country.
The civil aviation ministry's communication said the committee on redistribution of the vacated IndiGo slots held its first meeting on January 13, wherein the process and principles for redistribution were discussed.

The Founder and CEO of People Group said that startups today are growing faster than founders can grow as managers. He added that systems which work for a team of 10 often fail at 100, while those that work for 100 employees may break at 1,000.
“Most founders are great at 0 to 1 and 1 to 10. But beyond a certain growth curve, companies need a different skill set,” he said.
Mittal also noted that in global markets, it is common for founders step aside and let professional CEOs take over. He said such as practice is ‘encouraged’ because the company benefits from it, the founder retains the upside, and in most cases, shareholders are better off.
“In India we dramatize this as ‘fired’, ‘failure’ & even ‘fraud’. Most of the time it is none of that” he asserted, adding that making oneself replaceable should be one of the key goals of every founder.
Earlier this week, Deepinder Goyal stepped down from his position to pursue a new set of ideas he has felt drawn to for quite some time.
His resignation also comes amid intense public debate over gig work and labour conditions.
In recent weeks, Goyal, who has been vocal on social media in defending Zomato and its affiliate Blinkit's gig model, faced backlash after delivery worker unions called for nationwide strikes on December 25 and 31, demanding better pay, social security and safer working conditions.

The consolidated net profit of the Aditya Birla Group's cement arm rose 27% year-on-year to₹₹1,725.40 crore, according to its exchange filings. The profit beat theBloombergconsensus estimate of₹1,526 crore based on a poll of 21 analysts.
The Mumbai-headquartered cement maker’s revenue from operations rose by 23% to₹21,829.68 crore during the quarter, compared with₹17,778.83 crore a year ago, supported by higher sales volumes and contributions from acquired businesses. The company’s consolidated sales volumes stood at 38.87 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), up 15% from Q3FY25.
“India is witnessing a multi-year infrastructure build-out across roads, metros, railways, ports, and housing,” said Atul Daga, chief financial officer at UltraTech, in a post-earnings call with analysts, adding that “new avenues such as data centres, renewable energy, and urban infrastructure are driving incremental demand”.
UltraTech’s domestic grey cement capacity is 188.66mtpa. Including 5.4mtpa in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), its consolidated capacity stands at 194.06mtpa. By FY28, UltraTech plans to increase its total global cement capacity to 240.76mtpa.
“We should have approximately 8 million tonnes to 9 million tonnes more coming in this quarter, and the balance, I think 16-12 million tonnes in fiscal '27, and then remaining will be in '28,” he said.
In the current quarter, the company expects to operate at more than 90% of its installed capacity, said the company’s chief financial officer, up from 77% in Q3FY26.
UltraTech, in a statement, said the new labour codes led it to recognise a one-time exceptional charge of₹88.48 crore. The charge relates mainly to additional provisions for gratuity and compensated absences following changes in the definition of wages.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) for the quarter were₹4,051 crore compared to₹3,142 crore in Q3FY26. However, higher power and fuel costs as well as freight expenses continued to weigh on overall expenses during the quarter.
UltraTech reported strong performance driven by robust volume growth and effective cost control, exceeding street expectations and supporting healthy earnings. Looking ahead, management has guided for an improvement in Ebitda per tonne in the March quarter, led by better pricing and sustained volume momentum, according to Satyadeep Jain, lead analyst for cement, metals, mining and utilities at Ambit Capital.

The new wave of job cuts is expected to be carried out after bonuses are paid, the sources told the agency, although they did not specify the scale or location of the previously unreported plans.
The March layoffs are likely to mainly impact managing directors and senior employees across different parts of the bank, according to one of the sources. Some senior managers have already been moved to other divisions to keep their roles before the staff cuts begin, the agency report noted.
The latest round of layoff which happened this month also affected several senior employees, the second source toldReuters.
Citigroup said in a statement earlier this month that the bank will continue to reduce staff headcount in 2026. “These changes reflect adjustments we’re making to ensure our staffing levels, locations and expertise align with current business needs; efficiencies we have gained through technology; and progress against our Transformation work, which is nearing target state,” it said.
“We have been reducing headcount and expect that trend to continue as we take a step back and look at the trajectory of our expense base,” Mason told analysts in a separate earnings call, highlighting the $800 million expense related to severance last year.
In 2023 and 2024 the company publicly announced major layoffs as it was reducing management layers and selling assets, but the latest headcount reductions are being done more discreetly, as per the agency report.
The layoffs come as the bank is getting some relief from regulators. The US Federal Reserve has closed notices that directed the bank to fix its trading risk management weaknesses, while the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency rolled back a 2024 amendment to a 2020 regulatory punishment known as a consent order.

Rather, they proved that these platforms could adapt their logistics, merchant mix, and incentive design faster than consumer habits shift,” Liang Chen, a Professor of Strategy & Entrepreneurship at Singapore Management University, told CNBC.
Yao Jin, an associate professor of supply chain management at Miami University put it simply for CNBC, “American consumers overall don’t really care an app’s association with any specific country as long as they can find something they want at an affordable price.

Global law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, writing on behalf of Gautam Adani and with the consent of his nephew Sagar Adani, requested the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York to defer its ruling on a motion made by the SEC on 21 January, asAdani's counsel and the US regulator were discussing a stipulation on the case, showed the submission reviewed byMint.
A stipulation is a formal agreement between opposing parties during a lawsuit regarding a fact or procedure. It means that both parties agree on a fact or a procedure and do not need to discuss or debate it every time in court.
Adani's counsel did not indicate what was the stipulation being discussed with the SEC.
The case concerns allegations by US regulators in November 2024 that Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani, among others, paid bribes to government officials in India to secure favourable power-supply contracts for Adani Green Energy Ltd. The regulators claimed that the Adanis lied about the company’s anti-bribery policies when raising capital from American investors and did not disclose the alleged bribes they had paid, committing securities fraud.
Sullivan & Cromwell and the Adani Group did not immediately respond toMint's request for a comment.
The US regulator claimed the Indian government twice rejected its request to serve summonses on the Adani kin, citing procedural issues.
American laws require that a summons and a copy of the complaint be delivered in person to the accused to apprise them of the case against them.
The SEC has claimed that since Gautam Adani has publicly commented on the case and both he and Sagar Adani have also hired law firms to represent them, it can be assumed they are aware of the charges against them. Thus, the regulator sought the court’s nod to serve the summonses by email and through their US counsel.
Incidentally, Sullivan & Cromwell was not among the law firms the SEC cited as representing Gautam Adani in its filing on 21 January. According to the SEC disclosure, Sagar Adani has hired Hecker Fink Llp, while Gautam Adani has hired two firms Kirkland & Ellis LlP and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan Llp.

The SEC and the exchange now known as Gemini Space Station filed a joint stipulation in federal court in Manhattan to dismiss the case, citing the complete return of crypto assets to Gemini Earn investors through the Genesis Global Capital bankruptcy process between May and June 2024.
The SEC has shifted its approach to crypto enforcement under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has promised to be the ""crypto president,"" bringing in more favorable rules and pledging to popularize mainstream use of digital currencies.
Gemini did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular business hours.
In 2023, the SEC charged Genesis Global Capital and Gemini Trust Company with illegally selling securities to hundreds of thousands of investors through their crypto lending program.
Gemini customers who participated in the Gemini Earn program loaned their crypto to Genesis and were paid interest on their loaned assets. The total value of the Gemini Earn assets was $940 million when Genesis froze customer accounts in November 2022, Gemini previously said.
Unlike other crypto companies that went bankrupt after a 2022 market crash, Genesis was able to return customers' crypto to them rather than liquidating a limited pool of assets and paying them back in cash.
After ""the 100 percent in-kind return of Gemini Earn investors' crypto assets through the Genesis Bankruptcy and the settlements ... the Commission believes the dismissal of the claims against Defendant is appropriate,"" according to the court document filed on Friday.
The SEC emphasized that its decision to seek dismissal does not reflect its position on any other case.
Gemini last year made a strong debut on Nasdaq, underlining the rapid institutional adoption that has renewed investor optimism for digital assets. The exchange is currently valued at $1.14 billion according to data provided by LSEG.

US tariffs, Europe’s shift away from China and India’s push into semiconductors, solar and batteries are opening opportunities for companies that can build the equipment these industries need.
For TEAL, a Titan Company subsidiary with deep capabilities in automation and precision manufacturing, this convergence of global pressure points and domestic policy momentum is shaping its next phase of expansion.
“This is probably the best time for manufacturing in this country,"" said Sridhar N.P., managing director and chief executive of TEAL. “Unfortunately, it has come many years later than it should have, but better late than never. We are seeing industries where the entire value chain is coming in together. I do not know if this has ever happened elsewhere, where the whole ecosystem is being set up in two years.""
Even as India steps up investment in production capabilities across semiconductors, solar, batteries and electronics manufacturing, most of the equipment used in these sectors continues to be imported from China. TEAL sees an opportunity to emerge as a domestic alternative in selected equipment categories where its automation and precision engineering capabilities apply.
But changes are not restricted to the domestic market. Trump-era tariffs and broader geopolitical uncertainty have pushed companies globally to reassess supply chains and manufacturing footprints. While this expands opportunities for firms such as TEAL, it also raises questions around how prolonged trade tensions could shape future investment and market access.
TEAL operates across two businesses. One designs and builds automation equipment for high-volume manufacturing. The other manufactures high-precision components, primarily for global aerospace customers.
While the manufacturing services business, which is heavily focused on aerospace, has significant exposure to the US, the automation business has a very limited presence in that market. Although the company is keen to eventually scale its automation business in North America, tariff uncertainty has led it to pause expansion plans for now.
TEAL incorporated a US subsidiary several years ago, but Sridhar acknowledged that the company has not done much on that front. “North America is definitely an area of focus, but we are waiting and watching how we would want to do that (expand in the US market),"" he said. “On the automation front, we hardly export anything to the US, so that hasn’t been impacted, but it has impacted our North American strategy.""
Sridhar clarified that aerospace manufacturing exports have not been affected by tariffs, largely because of long-term contracts and deep customer relationships. About 95% of TEAL’s manufacturing services output is export-oriented, with the US as a key market.
Europe, meanwhile, presents a different dynamic. While industrial demand there has softened in the near term, structural factors are pushing European manufacturers to diversify supply chains away from China and towards alternative partners. Defence and aerospace spending in Europe is expected to rise sharply, but building capacity locally remains expensive.
According to Nithin Chandra, senior partner at consulting firm Kearney, this creates a natural pull towards India. “Europe will see a sharp increase in defence and aerospace spending, but creating capacity there is costly,"" he said. “That naturally pushes sourcing towards Asia, and India is viewed far more favourably than China as a long-term partner.""
Sridhar added that even as the US and Europe push to bring manufacturing closer to home, high labour costs in these regions make automation unavoidable rather than optional. This, he said, opens up a different operating model for automation suppliers, where proximity matters but full localisation is not essential.
“The same model that worked really well for the software industry can work for automation as well,"" he said, referring to an offshore–onsite approach. In this model, core design, engineering and equipment manufacturing can be done in India, with machines shipped overseas and final commissioning and tuning carried out on site. “If you do this model well, there is a very unique way in which we can render solutions,"" he said.
Even so, it is the Indian opportunity that excites TEAL the most. The government has been actively building a policy framework to reduce import dependence and attract technology-led manufacturing across semiconductors, electronics and new-energy sectors.
The flagship India Semiconductor Mission, backed by roughly₹76,000 crore in incentives, supports end-to-end semiconductor manufacturing, from design and fabrication to packaging and testing, with fiscal support of up to 50% of project cost for approved fabs and related infrastructure. Similar policy support has been extended to solar manufacturing and electronics production.
Industry, too, has responded. Intel and the Tata Group have signed a memorandum of understanding to localise semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging in India, with Tata’s semiconductor projects, including a fabrication plant and an OSAT facility, collectively valued at an estimated $14 billion.
India has seen manufacturing booms before, most notably in the automotive sector. But Sridhar argues the current cycle is fundamentally different in both speed and structure.
For instance, the automotive industry evolved gradually. India began by assembling vehicles using imported components. As volumes grew and incomes rose, suppliers followed, and over decades India built a balanced ecosystem where engines, tyres and systems are manufactured locally.
In semiconductors and solar, that progression is being compressed dramatically. “In semiconductors, everything is coming together,"" Sridhar said. “From silicon ingots to wafers, to fabs, to packaging and final ICs (integrated circuits). Massive investments are being made across the entire value chain at the same time."" A similar transformation is visible in solar manufacturing, among other sectors.
“What is not coming along is equipment,"" Sridhar said. “Whether it is semiconductor or whether it is solar, all the equipment today is coming in from China.""
TEAL is not attempting to become a maker of core semiconductor process tools or proprietary chemistry. That, Sridhar said, would be unrealistic. Instead, the company is targeting downstream and adjacent equipment where automation and precision engineering matter most.
This includes assembly automation, material handling, packaging equipment and discrete manufacturing systems for semiconductors, solar and electronics manufacturing services. The same logic extends to batteries, where India is building manufacturing capacity under production-linked incentives, but equipment and technology remain largely imported.
According to Kearney’s Chandra, this is a pragmatic strategy. “Becoming a full-fledged equipment OEM in semiconductors is extremely hard,"" he said. “Having said that, being a trusted component or subsystem supplier is a much more logical and scalable path, especially if done through partnerships.""
TEAL’s strategy is anchored in its twin businesses, which face very different demand dynamics.
The manufacturing services business is centred on high-precision components, primarily for aerospace. Much of the output from this segment is export-oriented, supplying critical parts used in commercial aircraft systems such as engine starters, air-management systems and thrust-reversal mechanisms.
This business has proven resilient even amid global disruption. “My aerospace (and defence) customers have not stopped taking from us,"" Sridhar said. “It is a very sticky business. In aerospace, you do not take short-term decisions because the ramifications on the supply chain are very high."" Long qualification cycles and switching costs mean aerospace supply chains tend to look beyond short-term tariff changes.
The automation business tells a different story. While it was evenly split between domestic and export markets last year, the balance has shifted decisively towards India. This year, about 70% of automation revenue is expected to be domestic, with exports accounting for the rest.
“While international opportunity is also growing, we see a far greater opportunity in India,"" said Sridhar.
In India, subsidiaries of these firms have built large businesses on enterprise relationships and broad portfolios. Honeywell Automation India, for instance, reported total revenue of₹4,189.6 crore in FY25.
Alongside them is a smaller group of Indian specialists, including robotics firms such as Addverb Technologies and GreyOrange, and aerospace component suppliers such as Aequs, Dynamatic Technologies and Sigma Advanced Systems.
Sridhar said both manufacturing services and automation equipment businesses will continue to see investment, particularly in factories and new technologies. The company is also looking to set up facilities in East Asia to better serve electronics equipment customers in the region, while investing in capabilities such as lasers, vision systems, robotics, high-speed automation and new-energy applications, especially batteries.
Chandra believes TEAL is well-positioned to benefit from emerging domestic and global opportunities. “This is a long-cycle opportunity,"" he said. “If semiconductors, solar, batteries and aerospace scale the way they are expected to, suppliers with deep engineering capability will compound over a decade or more.""

Venues that dumped Ticketmaster in favor of another ticket seller ended up losing about five concerts a year promoted by Live Nation, which meant forfeiting a combined total of about $1.5 million in revenue, or more than $300,000 per event, according to the government, which sued the company in 2024.
New York’s Barclays Center was among the venues that “lost concerts as a result of switching from Ticketmaster to a rival ticketer,” Bonny Sweeney, a Justice Department lawyer, said Friday at a court hearing in Manhattan. She added that many venues claim Ticketmaster’s services are inferior to those offered by rivals.
Live Nation, which merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, has denied claims that it operates an illegal monopoly. It has asked US District Judge Arun Subramanian to toss the government’s lawsuit or decide the case without the need for a trial, which has been scheduled for March 2.
After hearing arguments from both sides Friday, the judge didn’t say when he’d rule on the company’s request.
Live Nation controls more than 265 concert venues in North America and manages more than 400 musical artists, according to the antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department and some 30 states. Live Nation also controls about 87% of the concert ticketing market through its Ticketmaster subsidiary and more than 65% of the concert promotion market, Sweeney told the judge on Friday.
Andrew Gass, a lawyer for Live Nation, said the government investigated the company for years but only found eight alleged instances over 15 years where Live Nation threatened it would withhold concerts if a venue switched ticketing services. The government also failed to show evidence of harm created by the company’s policy requiring artists to use Live Nation’s promotion services at venues it owns, he said.
The government “needs some actual evidence these customers were made worse off,” Gass said.
The Justice Department argued that artists earned less from shows at Live Nation-owned amphitheaters.
The company instructed its employees not to increase artist guarantees — the amount of money it agrees to pay even if a concert is canceled — since they have to use Live Nation’s venues, government lawyer Lorraine Van Kirk said. Live Nation amphitheaters also have higher venue and service fees than similarly sized venues, often forcing artists to reduce their ticket prices to avoid having to charge fans more, she said.
The case is US v. Live Nation, 24-cv-3973, US District Court, Southern District of New York .

Though Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan managed to win the president’s confidence and save his own reputation in Washington, turning around his company is proving more arduous. Intel’s shares plunged Friday, tumbling as much as 17.5%, following a lackluster forecast that highlighted the company’s struggles in lining up big customers.
Just a few weeks ago, Trump had praised the company’s progress and its “very successful” CEO, as the president assessed early returns on the US investment. Tan took a more sober tone when speaking to investors on Thursday following the release of Intel’s quarterly results.
“We are on a multiyear journey,” Tan said on a conference call with analysts. “It will take time and resolve, but my team and I are committed to rebuilding this iconic American company.”
Intel’s first-quarter projections for revenue and earnings fell well short of Wall Street estimates. The company also disclosed that it still doesn’t have an anchor customer for its most advanced 14A process, though it expects firmer decisions from buyers in the second half of the year or the first half of 2027.
Intel shares were down 17% at 1:16 p.m. New York time, on course for their biggest one-day decline since 2024.
Tan acknowledged to investors that yields — the number of non-defective chips produced compared with the total possible capacity — are below his expectations. This metric is at the heart of chip manufacturing, as poor yields are likely to weigh on margins and deter possible customers for its foundry business, which makes chips for outside clients in its fabrication plants.
“Customers aren’t going to lock in unless they know they have a manufacturing process that can deliver,” JoAnne Feeney, a partner and portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management, said in an interview Friday on Bloomberg Television. “You have to know the supply will be there if you commit to a certain manufacturing partner. It’s a real chicken and egg problem.”
Since plans emerged for the US to become one of Intel’s top shareholders, the Santa Clara, California-based company’s stock had more than doubled, feverish gains that were pared by the latest projections. So far, the US owns 5.5% of Intel, a stake that’s currently worth roughly $12 billion, with options for the government to take ownership of additional shares in the future.
White House spokesman Kush Desai said Trump “remains committed to reshoring critical manufacturing and supporting American companies with a full policy suite of tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation. The Trump administration’s equity stake in Intel in particular represents how we are investing in the long-run success of American technology and manufacturing.”
Spokespeople for the US Commerce Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Some analysts see the US investment in the company as a crucial backstop to its long-term success. “This makes Intel’s fabs a strategic asset to the US military, and Intel has the full backing of the US government,” Gus Richard, an analyst at Northland Securities, wrote. “Intel needs to leverage its US government contacts and its US military industrial base foundry business into broader commercial relationships.”
While the success of Intel’s turnaround may not be clear for several more quarters, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is already achieving what Intel has sought. That includes building in the US, where TSMC plans to invest another $100 billion in Arizona as part of a Taiwan trade deal unveiled by the Trump administration last week. TSMC has promised to bring 12 advanced manufacturing and packaging facilities to Arizona by the mid-2030s.
Under the Taiwan agreement, companies investing in the US will receive an exemption on future potential chip tariffs to import as much as 2.5 times their American capacity, reducing the odds that the levies would make Intel’s products more attractive in the US market. Still, TSMC’s decision to continue adding manufacturing in Arizona points to a positive long-term trend for Intel: continued growth in demand for AI chips.
Intel has begun shipping its sub-2-nanometer 18A chips, a generation behind 14A, to customers from its manufacturing facilities in Arizona and Oregon. The company’s Chips Act-sponsored investment in Ohio has been repeatedly delayed, and the company avoided any mention of it in the Thursday investor call. The more than $28 billion project was supposed to be producing chips last year, but Intel now doesn’t expect to begin operations until 2030.

Rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 2025 are expected to pressure regional banks' interest income in the near term as loan yields fall faster than deposit costs, pressuring margins and earnings growth.
The bank expects annual net interest income — the difference between what it earns on loans and pays out on deposits — between $6.5 billion and $6.9 billion in 2026, compared with analysts' expectations of $6.92 billion, according to estimates provided by LSEG.
""Given continued rate cuts, we expect loan interest income to decline, driven by a declining yield despite asset growth levels,"" Chief Financial Officer Craig Nix told analysts.
The forecast assumes zero to four rate cuts of 25 basis points in 2026. The bank expects NII to trough in the first quarter.
""It has clearly been a difficult adjustment to lower rates and the debate will be whether this is the final cut,"" Truist analyst Brian Foran said.
The results also weighed on other bank stocks. The KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index was down about 3% in afternoon trading.
""Little good news from the financials today,"" said Macrae Sykes, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, pointing to First Citizens BancShares' weaker-than-expected 2026 NII forecast.
The bank reported a rise in fourth-quarter profit, helped by marginally higher NII in the last three months of 2025 and provisions that fell over 65% from last year.
First Citizens' adjusted profit available to common shareholders came in at $634 million in the three months ended December 31, compared with $628 million a year earlier.
The bank's stock gained just 1.6% in 2025 after two strong years with a growth of nearly 49% and 87% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. ‌ (Reporting by Pritam Biswas and Arasu Kannagi Basil in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)

Major companies, including Amazon, aim to cut thousands of corporate jobs across various divisions, potentially marking its largest layoffs yet. Ericsson plans to eliminate 1,600 jobs in Sweden to stay competitive, while FedEx will cut 500 jobs in France but also create new positions. Citigroup and BlackRock have announced significant layoffs.
These layoffs, possibly the company's largest, are expected to affect white-collar roles across divisions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), the People Experience and Technology unit (human resources), Prime Video, and retail. However, the report indicated that the plans might change.
“You have seen that we have reduced the headcount, for example, by 5,000 over the past year, and we expect to continue reducing headcount going forward,” Reuters quoted Ekholm during a post-earnings call.
On Friday, US parcel delivery company FedEx announced a strategic overhaul of its French domestic operations, including a plan to cut up to 500 jobs and invest about 78 million euros ($91.58 million).
FedEx plans to streamline its internal structure by cutting its station count from 103 to 86. This move aims to simplify the distribution network and eliminate unnecessary infrastructure across the country.
Although job cuts are part of the plan, the reorganisation is also expected to create over 770 new full-time and part-time roles. FedEx stated that employees affected by layoffs would be given priority consideration for these new positions.
The current round of job cuts at Citigroup is part of the company's plan, which was announced two years ago, to eliminate 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026, according to a Bloomberg report citing people aware of the development.
The Metropolitan Opera of New York announced a round of layoffs on Tuesday as it struggles financially, despite having implemented other significant cost-cutting measures over the past five years, according to a report by The New York Times.
Met announced additional cost-cutting measures, including salary reductions for its highest-paid employees and delaying a new production scheduled for the upcoming season.
According to the report, the opera house will reduce its administrative staff by 22, decreasing the total from 284 to approximately 262, which is about 10% of the division's workforce.
BlackRock earlier this month said it will fire hundreds of employees across the company, Bloomberg reported. According to a report citing people familiar with the development, BlackRock will lay off about 1% of its workforce, or about 250 employees across divisions.

Speaking at a conference call with analysts, DLF Ltd Managing Director Ashok Tyagi said housing demand in Gurugram, the company's key market, continues to remain strong, especially for credible developers.
Though the details about the senior living housing project are limited, the company noted that it plans to launch more projects in Gurugram, Mumbai, Panchkula and Goa.
Tyagi also expressed confidence about the company's capability of meeting the pre-sales target of₹20,000-22,000 crore during this fiscal, even as it has witnessed poor sales bookings in the latest December quarter.
“We stay confident to meet the original sales bookings guidance,” Tyagi was quoted as saying to analysts byPTI.
Explaining the reason for subdued sales of mere₹419 crore in the third quarter, he said the company paused sales bookings in its ongoing ultra-luxury residential project ‘The Dahilas’ in Gurugram last quarter and also did not launch any new housing project.
