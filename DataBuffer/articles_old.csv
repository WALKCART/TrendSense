Investor sentiment toward blue-chip stocks improved during the year, as the once-favourite small-cap segment faced EPS cuts amid rich valuations, making the large-cap segment the standout performer compared to both mid- and small-cap averages.
The rally significantly outperformed the Nifty Midcap 100’s gain of 5.8%, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 index skidded 5.6% — its first annual drop in two years.
Of the 50 constituents of the index, 32 closed the year with positive returns, with 26 of them beating the index, rallying between 11% and 72%, Trendlyne data showed.
Shriram Finance led the charge with a massive surge of 72.4% to₹996 apiece, marking its fifth consecutive year of gains.
Metal stocks also hogged the spotlight, with sharp rallies across both base and precious metals pushing prices higher. Hindalco Industries delivered a 47% return, while improving steel spreads triggered a 30% rally in both Tata Steel and JSW Steel.
All major banks delivered strong returns, led by State Bank of India, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and HDFC Bank, which rallied in the 12–24% range.
NBFC and insurance stocks such as SBI Life Insurance, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, and HDFC Life Insurance Company soared 46%, 43%, 30%, and 21.5%, respectively.
Reliance Industries, India’s most valuable company by market capitalisation, delivered its biggest annual gain since 2020, advancing 29% to₹1,570 apiece.
Other key top performers from the pack included Bharat Electronics, Bharti Airtel, Tata Consumer Products, Titan Company, Asian Paints, Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone, Nestle India, Grasim Industries, Larsen & Toubro, and IndiGo, all of which surged between 12% and 35% in 2025.
Domestic brokerage Axis Securities believes key headwinds, such as weak corporate earnings, stretched valuations, and tariff-related concerns, that weighed on market sentiment are likely to ease in 2026.
Motilal Oswal also remains positive on the Indian stock market and believes equities are well-positioned to recover from the underperformance seen in CY2025, supported by improving earnings visibility, supportive domestic macroeconomic conditions, and an easing geopolitical environment.
Earlier, global brokerage firms such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Jefferies also turned bullish on the Indian stock market, expecting that GST rate cuts and repo rate reductions could boost consumption and drive an earnings recovery.

ITC sells cigarette brands like Classic and Gold Flake. Godfrey Phillips, manufacturer of Marlboro and Four Square, plunged 19% in intraday deals.
Analysts foresee a negative impact on sales as this move could likely increase cigarette prices.
“While we are still unsure on the final outcome, if confirmed, this will be a clear negative as volumes will be impacted and concerns would also re-emerge on risk of losing some volumes to illicit industry,” Jefferies analysts were quoted byBloombergas saying.Mintcould not independently verify this.
The brokerage has estimated that ITC would need to hike cigarette prices by “at least 15%” to pass on the overall impact to consumers.
The sharp correction in ITC following the excise duty hike should be viewed more as a sentiment-driven adjustment than a structural reset of fundamentals, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVAsset PMS.
He said that historically, cigarette tax hikes tend to trigger immediate stock price reactions as markets discount near-term volume pressure and margin uncertainty. ""However, over time, the actual earnings impact has often been more measured, given the industry’s ability to pass on taxes through calibrated price increases.""
G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equionomics Research, sees multiple overhangs on the ITC stock as he remains doubtful over its ability to give any meaningful returns.
He said that the government will likely keep raising duties on cigarette companies due to GST cuts across many consumer products. The government in September 2025 reduced the tax rates on several products to boost consumption amid a massive 50% tariff on Indian exports by the US, one of the highest in Asian economies.
Chokkalingam said that the highly profitable hotel business is no longer a direct part of it. ""The paper segment is doing badly, the IT services segment has also not shown significant profit growth, and other FMCG growth also remains slow. Further, equity selling by its largest shareholder, British American Tobacco Plc, is also possible, leading to more pressure on the stock price front,"" he said.
Against this backdrop, the market veteran said that in the best-case scenario, ITC is just a HOLD after today’s meltdown.
According to Dasani, for long-term investors, such policy-led drawdowns often create opportunities to accumulate high-quality, cash-rich businesses at more reasonable valuations. ""Near-term volatility cannot be ruled out until there is greater clarity on pricing actions and volume trends over the next few quarters.""
As per Trendlyne data, 23 analysts have 'Strong Buy', 10 analysts have 'Buy', and one analyst has each 'Hold' and 'Sell' ratings on ITC stock.

After years of strong gains, valuation excesses corrected meaningfully, triggering steep decline in 2025. The Nifty Smallcap 100 index declined 7% in 2025, reflecting the severity of the correction.
Among small-cap funds, Quantum Small Cap Fund emerged as the category leader, delivering a positive return of 1.81% and standing out as the only fund to end in the green. It was followed by Sundaram Small Cap, HDFC Small Cap, PGIM India Small Cap and ICICI Prudential Smallcap Fund, all of which posted negative returns ranging between -1.56% and -1.88%.
In contrast to the volatility seen in small-cap mutual funds, bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to offer better stability and predictability, albeit with lower return potential. In 2025, most large banks offered FD interest rates in the range of 6% to 7.5%, providing assured returns and capital protection.
However, while short-term returns disappointed, long-term performance told a very different story. Several well-managed small-cap funds continued to deliver exceptionally strong five-year compounded annual growth rates (CAGR), highlighting the importance of patience, disciplined investing, and superior stock selection in this volatile segment.
Quant Small Cap Fund: The fund remained the category leader over the long term with a five-year CAGR of over 30%. Its aggressive, high-conviction strategy amplified volatility in 2025 but rewarded investors handsomely over longer cycles.
Nippon India Small Cap Fund: It delivered a five-year CAGR of around 28% underlining strong execution across market cycles.
Bandhan Small Cap Fund: Long-term investors continued to benefit from a solid five-year CAGR of over 27%.
Invesco India Smallcap Fund: Over five years, it delivered a CAGR of over 27%, aided by disciplined risk management and a competitive expense ratio of about 0.40%.
Edelweiss Small Cap Fund: Its five-year CAGR of around 26% reflects a balanced approach to growth and risk control, making it one of the steadier performers in the category.
Small-cap mutual funds invest in companies with market capitalisation below₹5,000 crore, typically outside the top 250 listed firms. These businesses are often early in their growth cycle and relatively unknown, which creates opportunities for outsized returns — but also exposes investors to high volatility and sharp drawdowns in the short to medium term.
The key advantages of small-cap funds include early exposure to potential future leaders and higher long-term return potential. However, they are best suited for very aggressive investors with a minimum investment horizon of seven years or more, who can withstand interim corrections like the one seen in 2025.
The lesson from 2025 is clear: while small-cap investing can be unforgiving in the short term, quality fund selection and time in the market remain the biggest drivers of long-term wealth creation.",6

The exchange’s five-for-one stock split will take effect on 2 January, lowering the share price mechanically, but not the valuation. That has already expanded sharply, with MCX shares rising nearly 80% in 2025.
That momentum is visible in MCX’s transaction revenue. In Q2, the exchange earned₹114 crore from futures and₹223 crore from options, taking total transaction charges to₹337 crore, largely flat sequentially. What changed meaningfully was the revenue mix, which tilted in favour of bullion trading from energy trading. Energy trading’s share of transaction charges fell from 64% in Q1 to 57% in Q2, while bullion’s contribution rose from 36% to 43%. The shift reflects both an absolute decline in energy turnover and a rise in bullion turnover. Turnover here refers to the sum of value of futures trading plus premium value of options.
One such initiative is the launch of monthly options contracts on the MCX BULLDEX index from October, which tracks gold and silver in a 60:40 ratio. The MCX Management expects these contracts to broaden participation across retail traders, hedgers and institutional investors. The exchange is also evaluating weekly contracts, mirroring those available for equity indices at the BSE Ltd and National Stock Exchange (NSE).
Higher prices do not necessarily mean higher value. Transaction charges depend on the price of the commodity and trading volume. Take the case of equities. The NSE average daily turnover fell to₹94,400 crore in December, from₹104,000 crore in the year-ago period. Over the same period, the broader-based Nifty 500 index has gained 6.7%. As a result, the price increased, but volume declined, leading to lower turnover in value terms.
The same risk applies to commodities. It remains to be seen if the trading volume surge in bullion contracts stays intact even when prices continue to move higher. If volumes don’t rise adequately, investors should note that MCX’s transaction revenue could drop despite higher bullion prices. So, given the earnings risk, investors should evaluate if MCX has more steam left, considering its 50x P/E ratio, as per Bloomberg consensus FY27 estimates, is at almost a 25% premium to BSE.",-1

While the benchmark index rose 10.51%, the Nifty IT index dropped 12.6% last year.
Most major IT companies, including TCS, HCL Tech, and Infosys, suffered losses in double digits in 2025. However, after the recent correction, several experts have started spotting value emerging in the sectors.
Seema Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities, anticipates a transition in the IT sector from a cyclical recovery to a structural growth phase in FY26, driven primarily by AI-led transformation.
""Large Indian IT companies such as TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro, LTIMindtree and Tech Mahindra are experiencing a meaningful improvement in deal quality, with nearly three-fourths of new contract wins now linked to AI-led services, including generative AI, agentic workflows, machine learning, analytics and intelligent automation,"" said Srivastava.
Srivastava underscored that this shift signals a clear exit from the demand slowdown of recent years and improves revenue visibility, making large IT players attractive core portfolio holdings for investors seeking stability, strong cash flows and balance-sheet strength.
Srivastava said that while global macro uncertainty, geopolitical risks and cautious enterprise IT spending may continue to limit discretionary demand in traditional services, sustained investments in AI, cloud migration, data platforms and cybersecurity support earnings resilience and gradual margin expansion.
""Growth for Indian IT services is expected to improve to the mid- to high-single-digit range over FY26–FY27, aided by AI-led deal ramp-ups and vendor consolidation, while India’s overall IT spending is projected to exceed $176 billion in 2026, benefiting large incumbents with scale and execution capability,"" said Srivastava.
Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, highlighted that after a prolonged period of global uncertainty, sentiment is turning more optimistic as expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and rapid AI adoption begin to influence client spending decisions.
Mishra underscored that while recent financial performance has remained stable, a consistent pipeline of cloud, data, and AI-led deal wins indicates that demand is gradually reviving.
""Management commentary across leading IT companies suggests that the recovery is likely to gather momentum by mid-FY26 and strengthen further into FY27 as discretionary technology budgets reopen,"" said Mishra.
According to Mishra, the Indian IT sector now appears to be at the beginning of a new, more disciplined, AI-driven growth cycle. Firms that invest decisively in innovation, talent, and high-value digital capabilities will be best positioned to lead the sector’s next phase of growth.
Among the IT key players, Mishra said HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra are promising in the short term.
Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities, suggests Coforge as a mid-cap pick. Among the large-cap companies, he suggests Infosys.
""Sector rotation has been very sharp, and IT stocks tend to correct suddenly even when there is no change in fundamentals,"" Tapse said.

Since securities mature within 91 days, changes in interest rates have a limited impact on the fund's value. This makes liquid funds among the lowest-risk mutual fund categories.
An emergency corpus requires two characteristics: immediate accessibility and capital preservation. Liquid funds deliver both more effectively than most alternatives.
The standard recommendation suggests maintaining 6-9 months of essential expenses as an emergency fund. For a household with₹50,000 monthly essential expenses, this translates to₹3-4.5 lakh.
A practical allocation strategy involves splitting this corpus: 60-70% in liquid funds and 30-40% in savings accounts or bank fixed deposits.
For a₹5 lakh emergency corpus, this means₹3 lakh distributed across two liquid funds from different AMCs with₹1.5 lakh in each, and₹2 lakh kept in a savings account or FD.
This structure provides₹1 lakh in instantly accessible funds through the₹50,000 instant redemption limit from each fund, plus the₹2 lakh in the savings account. For larger emergencies requiring the full corpus, the remaining₹2 lakh from liquid funds arrives within 1-2 business days.
The diversification across two AMCs reduces dependency on a single fund house's systems and provides backup if one fund faces temporary redemption delays.
Goals with timelines under three years cannot afford equity market volatility. A market correction six months before you need the money can derail the entire plan.
Liquid funds work for goals with high certainty of achievement: a planned home down payment in 18 months, a car purchase in two years, or funding a wedding in 30 months. These are discretionary goals where you control the timing and have committed to the expense.
The returns from liquid funds won't dramatically accelerate goal achievement. They typically deliver 1% above the prevailing repo rate, currently around 6 to 6.5%. The value lies in preserving capital while generating returns modestly ahead of inflation, which savings accounts cannot consistently deliver.
Liquid funds serve as a holding area for money awaiting deployment. This includes annual bonuses, proceeds from asset sales, profits booked from equity investments, or any windfall requiring a decision on final allocation.
Many investors default to keeping such amounts in savings accounts, earning 3-4% while deciding what to do. Liquid funds generate 6 to 6.5% during this period with identical liquidity for amounts up to₹50,000 per fund and minimal delay for larger sums.
Systematic Transfer Plans leverage this by parking lump sums in liquid funds and transferring fixed amounts monthly into equity funds. For example, placing₹10 lakh in a liquid fund and setting up a₹1 lakh monthly STP into an equity fund provides rupee cost averaging while the remaining amount earns returns instead of sitting idle.
For amounts up to₹50,000, liquid funds offer true instant redemption 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, including weekends and holidays. The money arrives via IMPS within minutes.
A redemption request on Saturday afternoon reaches your account the same day. A Sunday evening request processes immediately. This feature operates outside market hours and banking holidays.
However, instant redemption requires investing directly with the AMC or in Statement of Account mode. It does not work for units held in demat form. Check your investment mode before assuming instant access.
Amounts exceeding₹50,000 follow standard mutual fund settlement cycles. Redemption requests on business days settle on T+1, meaning funds arrive the next business day.
Weekend requests are treated as Monday submissions because mutual fund transactions are processed only on business days. A Saturday request receives funds on Tuesday, a three-day wait. A Sunday request also receives funds on Tuesday, a two-day wait.
To ensure the Monday arrival of funds, submit redemption requests by Friday before 3 PM. This matters when planning large expenses requiring amounts above₹50,000.
Liquid funds provide tax deferral advantages over fixed deposits, though not necessarily lower tax rates.
In fixed deposits, interest income faces Tax Deducted at Source annually, even if you don't withdraw the interest. Your capital compounds on post-tax amounts. For someone in the 30% tax bracket, a 7% FD effectively compounds at 4.9% after annual tax deduction.
In liquid funds, no tax applies until redemption. Your entire capital compounds at the pre-tax rate. Tax liability arises only when you redeem, and you pay based on your income tax slab at that time.
Both short-term and long-term capital gains from liquid funds are taxed at your income slab rate, matching FD taxation. The benefit lies purely in deferral, allowing compounding on the full amount rather than post-tax amounts.
For investors in lower tax brackets or those planning redemptions in years with reduced income, this deferral can produce meaningful differences over multi-year periods.
Liquid funds are generally low-risk but not zero-risk. Risk emerges when fund managers chase higher yields by compromising credit quality.
If most liquid funds yield 6.5% and one fund consistently delivers 7.5%, investigate why. Higher yields usually mean the fund holds lower-rated commercial papers or corporate bonds rated AA+ or A2 instead of AAA and A1+ rated securities.
One default in a lower-rated security can eliminate months of extra yield. A fund holding commercial paper that defaults on repayment sees its NAV drop immediately. Recovering that principal takes months or years through legal processes.
A reasonable benchmark suggests liquid fund yields should stay within 1% of the repo rate. Currently, with the repo rate around 6.5%, liquid funds yielding 6.5-7.5% operate within safe parameters. Anything significantly higher warrants caution.
Always prioritise credit quality over marginal return differences. Liquid funds exist for capital preservation and liquidity, not return maximisation. Chasing an extra 50 basis points by accepting credit risk defeats their purpose.
Understanding what liquid funds do well and what they don't do determines whether they belong in your financial plan. For most investors with emergency funds, short-term goals, or periodic surplus cash, liquid funds deserve a role. For others, different instruments may serve better.

On technical charts, Adani Power is attempting a breakout from a six-week box formation near 146, reclaiming the 10, 20, and 50-day EMAs on the daily chart, according to Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree.
""On higher timeframes, the 20-week EMA has acted as a clear launchpad, supporting the current rebound. The structure signals a tactical recovery rather than a trend reversal, as the stock remains locked in a broader consolidation phase,"" said Jain.
A sustained close above 146, supported by volume expansion, can drive a deeper bounce toward the 158 to 160 zone, he opined. However, this area is likely to attract supply, given the larger weekly cooling structure. ""Risk–reward favours short-term trades, not positional longs. The rally is expected to lose steam near 160, with price likely reverting into consolidation thereafter.""
Meanwhile, Adani Power share price has been trading on an ex-split basis in a 1:5 ratio since September 22.
Billionaire Gautam Adani-led power company is sharpening its growth ambitions by expanding capacity and securing landmark tenders to meet India’s rising electricity demand.
The company has raised its long-term installed capacity target to 41.87 gigawatts (GW) by FY32 and committed a capital expenditure of about₹2 lakh crore, signalling one of the most aggressive private-sector expansion plans in India’s thermal power industry,PTIreported on December 24, citing sources.
The revised target marks a sharp step-up from the company’s earlier plan of 30.67 GW by FY30, the report said, citing the same sources.
Earlier reports also indicated that the Adani Group is in talks with officials in the Uttar Pradesh government to build eight 200-megawatt small modular reactors.
Under the new law, private companies would need to obtain licenses to operate nuclear power plants, while foreign firms can participate through partnerships with Indian companies.
Adani Power share price witnessed sharp selling after reaching a record high of₹182.70 apiece in September this year, and as of the previous close, it is down 22.2% from that level. However, strong gains during the first half of 2025 helped the stock close the year with a 35% return, marking its fifth consecutive year of gains.
During 2025, APL reached several milestones. Its power generation capacity grew after it bought Vidharbha Industries and Power Ltd near Nagpur. The company also committed to investing more than $ 22 billion in projects through 2032.
In terms of long-term performance, Adani Power shares have delivered a 149% return over the last three years and surged 1,400% over the past five years, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the Adani group.

A liquidity- and retail-fuelled boom has given way to a market where returns hinge squarely on earnings durability rather than momentum. Investors should expect fewer easy winners, wider return dispersion, and stock selection to matter far more than market direction, according to experts.
Between 2020 and 2023, nearly 97% of BSE 500 constituents delivered positive returns, with three-fourths rising more than 80%, according to aMintanalysis of 400 of the BSE 500 stocks. The broad-based rally created a rare environment where momentum often outweighed fundamentals.
The market’s character shifted in 2025, as broad post-Covid gains gave way to selective performance driven by earnings and fundamentals. Nearly 12% of companies that had gained strongly during the earlier period have since seen significant declines. These are the market’s “fireflies” — stocks that surged during the post-Covid rally but are now fading as conditions normalize.
For most of these companies, the market appears to be recalibrating expectations rather than reassessing long-term viability.
Ashish Chaturmohta, managing director and fund manager at Apex PMS, JM Financial, said the reversals reflect aggressive extrapolation of pandemic-era demand.
Chaturmohta said the uneven returns are rooted in how this market cycle unfolded. The post-Covid rally, he argued, was structurally distinct, with retail-driven momentum overwhelming fundamental discipline. “Valuations raced ahead of earnings durability, and high-growth narratives crumbled when liquidity and sentiment cooled,” he said.
Sectoral trends reinforce this view. While fireflies are spread across the market, chemicals and banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) companies dominate the list, followed by capital goods and consumer durables.
The pattern underscores a decisive shift from liquidity-fuelled breadth to fundamentals-led selectivity.
Sharma said stocks that have held up share a common trait: performance was earnings-led rather than liquidity-driven. Strong balance sheets, disciplined capital allocation and the ability to protect margins across cycles allowed these companies to remain resilient even as conditions normalized.
Divergence, Sharma said, is likely to persist as capital becomes more selective without the support of easy liquidity. Chaturmohta expects 2026 to favour companies with strong earnings quality, cash-flow conversion, and resilient balance sheets, particularly in a macro environment shaped by geopolitical uncertainty and volatile commodity cycles.",6

Thursday’s price movement mirrors the broader trend observed through much of 2025, with underlying demand–supply dynamics continuing to keep the rupee under pressure.
""While the calendar has changed, volatility is likely to persist. Under Governor Sanjay Malhotra, the RBI appears comfortable allowing the rupee to adjust with market forces, while remaining actively present to smooth excessive moves and maintain orderly conditions,"" CR Forex Advisors MD Amit Pabari was quoted as saying byPTI.
Pabari further said that progress toward reviving the paused India–US trade deal remains a key upside risk and could significantly lift confidence if finalised.
In 2025, the Indian currency depreciated by 6%, recording one of the worst declines among Asian currencies this year.
“Foreign portfolio flows will be critical. Equity and debt inflows have historically provided stability to the rupee, while persistent outflows tend to amplify weakness. Any sharp rise in oil prices widens the trade deficit and increases dollar demand, weakening the currency. Conversely, softer energy prices can provide meaningful support by improving the current account balance. Markets will watch closely for signals on how tolerant the RBI remains of currency moves, the scale and timing of its interventions, and the use of instruments such as FX swaps and liquidity operations,” Sodhani said.
On the outlook of the Indian Rupee, he further added that the rupee is likely to remain sensitive to global cues, with intermittent bouts of volatility driven by dollar movements and capital flows.
“Any positive on the US-India tariff front may provide support to the rupee. For the USDINR pair, 88.20-93.80 may remain a broader band for 2026,” he added.

Between 2016 and 2025, the index delivered positive returns in all 10 years, navigating global slowdowns, policy shocks, the Covid-19 pandemic, and sharp global tightening cycles while maintaining a long-term upward trajectory. This consistency has played a key role in strengthening investor confidence in India’s equity markets and expanding domestic participation.
Returns moderated again in 2018, with the index rising 3.15%, but momentum picked up in 2019, when the Nifty gained 12.02%. What stood out most was the index’s performance during the Covid period. Despite the sharp sell-off in early 2020, the Nifty ended that year with a 14.90% gain, followed by a powerful rally of 24.12% in 2021, fuelled by unprecedented liquidity, fiscal support and economic reopening.
The tightening of global financial conditions did slow returns, but did not derail the broader trend. In 2022, the Nifty still managed a 4.32% gain despite aggressive global rate hikes. Performance accelerated again in 2023, with a 19.42% rise, supported by strong domestic flows and improving earnings visibility. The index added 8.75% in 2024 and followed it up with another 10.28% gain in 2025, extending its rare streak of annual gains and highlighting its ability to compound steadily across market cycles.
Market participants note that while returns in recent years have been more measured compared to the post-Covid surge, the quality of gains has improved, with broader participation and healthier earnings support.
Looking ahead, brokerage houses remain constructive but measured on the Nifty’s prospects. Geojit Financial Services said the Nifty is currently hovering close to its December 2025 base-case target of 26,500, supported by strong domestic fundamentals and easing global risk factors. The brokerage marginally upgraded its December 2026 base target to 29,150, implying a potential 12% year-on-year return.
As investors position portfolios for 2026, Mirae Asset Mutual Fund continues to stress goal-based asset allocation, bottom-up stock selection and diversification across large caps, flexi-cap and multi-cap strategies. Hybrid funds are being recommended to smooth volatility, while higher-risk investors may selectively look at consumption, banking and financial services, and infrastructure themes.

This is raising concerns of pressure on profitability amid muted realizations.
Average all-India cement prices fell 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in Q3FY26 to₹336 per bag of 50 kg, as per Elara Securities (India).
Prices in Tamil Nadu and Kerala fell by around₹5 per bag, while prices in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were flat month-on-month in December.
The problem of the South? The region has been primarily experiencing an oversupply, along with relatively lower demand growth. But heightened competitive intensity lately has exacerbated the pain on prices.
But this chase for market share is delaying pricing revival in the industry. The Ramco Cements India Ltd and Dalmia Bharat Ltd are among the other companies that have exposure to this region.
In this backdrop, a quick respite to the demand-supply mismatch woes seen in the South is unlikely. “South region is expected to witness the second-highest addition of capacities over the next four years, totalling 46 million tonnes per annum,” said the PL Capital report on 31 December.
PL Capital notes that while a lot of infrastructure projects have been announced by these state governments, implementation has been delayed over the last six months. The brokerage expects the utilisation level in this region to inch up gradually over the next three years to 62% from 61% in FY25.
Meanwhile, channel checks by some brokerages suggest that dealers in the South may attempt to pass on price hikes in January. However, sustaining potential price increases in the near term can be challenging, as the upcoming festivals of Makar Sankranti and Pongal may temporarily impact construction activity and lead to a labour shortage.",2

Listed sectoral peers such as InterGlobe Aviation, SpiceJet, Dreamfolks Services, Taneja Aerospace Aviation, and Global Vectra Helicorp have, in contrast, shed 16% to 54% in the second half of calendar 2025.
Why is GMR Airports the only one among listed aviation stocks pulling ahead while the airline plays languish?
The answer lies in the market showing its preference towards established airports with steady annuity-like revenues and recent regulatory changes that benefit GMR.
Investor appetite for airport stocks, to be sure, is visible among unlisted airport operators as well.
While Bengaluru International Airport isn’t traded in the unlisted space, Cochin International Airport’s unlisted shares have more than doubled over the past two years, said Manan Doshi, co-founder of Unlisted Arena, an online trading platform for unlisted stocks. The Kochi airport operator's shares have risen to₹455 now from₹210. Shares of Kannur International Airport in north Kerala have climbed 30% moving from₹100 to₹130 over the same period.
GMR runs five airports in India–primary among them being Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad, and Manohar International Airport in Goa–and the Mactan-Cebu International Airport in the Philippines, per its website. The Delhi airport is India's busiest.
What works in GMR’s favour is its 30 to 60 year-concession agreements, which offer strong visibility on sustainable cash flows, noted Ankita Shah, vice president at Elara Capital.
The recent rally in its stock is rooted in fundamentals, with the new tariff order at the Delhi International Airport set to lift revenues. For the airport in the capital, the five-year period between FY25 and FY29 marks a key shift after regulators approved a sharp hike in aeronautical tariffs.
That is because the yield per passenger has risen to about₹360 in FY25 from₹145 in FY24, a 147% jump, Shah explained. What the hike reflects is the approval of Delhi International Airport’s larger asset base and recovery of past investments, including Covid-related losses.
“As a result, expect aero revenues to compound at a ~43% CAGR in FY25-28E, purely from tariff uplift,” Shah said.
Other airports also enjoy stable tariff visibility, while non-aeronautical revenues such as duty free shopping, retail rentals, cargo and car parking–earlier largely routed through JVs–are now increasingly moving in-house, market participants said.
Shah believes there is still upside in the stock, with GMR emerging as the biggest beneficiary of rising passenger traffic, especially as airlines continue to add capacity. “The growth story is not fully priced in yet.”
Looking ahead, the next growth phase, led by non-aero and commercial property, will shift GMR from a utility to a consumption play, with FY26 marking a turning point, as PAT turns positive, deleveraging starts with capital expenditure peaking out, and credit rating upgraded, Shah explained.
GMR’s executive director Saurabh Chawla flagged as much recently. “We are steadfast in our long-term strategy of converting GMR Airports into a consumer business with the underpinnings of a utility company,” he said in its latest FY26 Q2 earnings call with analysts on 14 November.
Elara Capital has initiated coverage on the stock with a ‘buy’ rating and a target price of Rs123, in its 4 November report.
It is not just GMR but Adani Enterprises also expects to increase share of non-aero revenue to 75% from 61% currently at Mumbai, while for the other airports in its portfolio it targets 25% non-aero share, Priyankar Biswas, research analyst at JM Financial Institutional Securities.
“In particular, we have witnessed strong non-aero growth in key hub airports, and we expect growth to strengthen even more,"" said Biswas. Delhi and Mumbai airports have higher non-aero share than the likes of Heathrow (22%) and Amsterdam (38%), he added.
Even so, India’s duty-free segment, which makes up a large part of non-aero revenues, is still under-penetrated compared with global aviation hubs.
Even at metro airports, duty free penetration is around 10%, versus 15% in Dubai and 18% in Singapore, despite similar international footfalls of about 40%. This is mainly due to lower passenger spending and limited store formats, Biswas said. However, he believes that rising incomes, better international connectivity, growing outbound travel, and upgraded airport infrastructure, along with experiential retail and digital pre-orders, offer strong growth potential.
GMR took over duty-free operations at Delhi in July 2025 and at Hyderabad from September 2025. As a result, the standalone entity now includes duty-free businesses at the Delhi, Hyderabad, and Goa airports, car parking at Hyderabad and Goa, cargo operations at Delhi and Goa, and retail operations at Hyderabad.
One of the primary reasons for the investor interest in GMR, is that the operator remains the only pure-play listed bet on the airport theme in India, Biswas highlighted.
“That dynamic could change if Adani Enterprises decides to list its airport business. Such a move would give investors an alternative and could influence future re-rating, especially given Adani’s track record of scaling businesses rapidly,"" Biswas said.",5

At the same time, Bajaj Finance continues to benefit from deep penetration in retail credit and digital lending.
Consumption-linked sectors are emerging as a powerful driver, aided by rising disposable incomes, improving rural demand, and policy tailwinds. Auto and consumer discretionary names, such as Uno Minda, Tata Motors' commercial vehicle, and Mahindra & Mahindra, stand to gain from a recovery in passenger vehicles, SUVs, and rural-focused segments. FMCG leaders, such as Hindustan Unilever and Britannia, offer steady earnings visibility and defensive stability during volatile phases. Infrastructure, Defence, and capital goods form another important pillar, with companies like BEL, JSW Infra, and Larsen & Toubro enjoying strong order books and long-term execution visibility.
The telecom sector adds a structural growth layer, with Bharti Airtel benefiting from higher ARPU, data consumption, and 5G monetisation. The IT sector is expected to play a supporting role, with prominent IT names like TCS and Infosys offering comfort through strong balance sheets, high cash generation, and improving medium-term growth visibility.
Additionally, the metal and energy sectors are poised for growth, driven by increasing demand for infrastructure and renewable energy. Companies such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Hindalco, SJVN, Power Grid, and NTPC are well-positioned to benefit from these trends. Coal India and Oil India are also expected to benefit from the increasing energy demand.

The takeaway was clear: portfolio construction and stock selection mattered far more than index direction. Investors who relied solely on benchmark movements often found themselves disconnected from their actual returns.
2025 reinforced the importance of diversification across both geographies and asset classes. India’s relative underperformance during parts of the year highlighted the risks of domestic concentration. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, said the year delivered a strong message on asset allocation. “There are two key takeaways from 2025. One is the importance of geographical diversification, and the other is adopting a multi-asset strategy that gives due weight to precious metals,” he said.
Gold and other non-equity assets helped cushion portfolios during volatile phases, underscoring the need for balance rather than aggressive equity-only positioning.
Volatility through the year rewarded investors who followed discipline over narratives. Aakash Shah, Research Analyst at Choice Broking, said technical discipline proved crucial. “2025 reinforced the importance of trend discipline and risk management. Stocks respecting moving averages and breakouts delivered steadier returns, while ignoring stop-losses led to sharp drawdowns,” he said.
Sector rotation and relative strength analysis also played a key role, as leadership changed frequently. Investors chasing momentum without a framework often found themselves on the wrong side of reversals.
Another lesson the market reinforced was that valuations eventually catch up, regardless of sentiment. Several stocks trading at elevated multiples struggled to justify expectations, even as broader indices held up. Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital, said investors must remain valuation-conscious. “If you invest at high valuations, don’t expect high returns. Markets will go up and down, and investors should be mentally prepared for 30 percent-plus drawdowns without panicking or trying to time exits,” he said.
The year reminded investors that long-term wealth creation requires patience, not perfect timing.
Perhaps the most enduring lesson from 2025 was that attempts to time exits and re-entries often did more harm than good. Sharp pullbacks tempted investors to sell, while recoveries came faster than expected. Those who exited frequently struggled to re-enter before markets stabilised. The year reinforced the value of staying invested through cycles, focusing on business quality and long-term growth rather than reacting to short-term noise.
As markets enter 2026, the lessons of 2025 serve as a reality check. While opportunities remain abundant, success is likely to favour investors who combine discipline, diversification and valuation awareness with the patience to let fundamentals play out.

The staggered duty, which will fall to 11.5% in the second year and 11% in the third year, will apply only to products imported at prices below certain thresholds, according to a gazette notification dated December 30.
India is the latest country to respond to a global oversupply that has driven steel prices to multi-year lows, with elevated flows from China. The duty will be levied on key flat steel products, including hot-rolled coils and plates, cold-rolled coils, metallic-coated steel, and color-coated steel.
Steel consumption in India, which has remained robust over the past three fiscal years, is expected to accelerate further in the coming years, supported by the government’s continued focus on infrastructure expansion and rising construction activity.
It expects demand to remain robust at a 7.2% CAGR over FY25–FY31E, reaching 230 million tonnes, noting that once-sluggish segments such as aerospace, shipbuilding, and oil and gas are also beginning to add demand as new projects come on stream.
Tata Steel’s share price concluded 2025 with a stellar 30.5% rally, outperforming the Nifty 50’s gain of 10.5%, as Street sentiment was buoyed by the company’s expansion plans, a recovery in steel prices, rising domestic steel demand, along with its expanding downstream portfolio and strong raw material integration.
In its board meeting held on December 10, 2025, Tata Steel outlined its long-term growth strategy for Indian operations, which includes a 4.8 MTPA expansion at Neelachal Ispat Nigam (NINL), signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Lloyd Metals to collaborate on iron ore mining infrastructure and steelmaking, setting up a 6 MTPA greenfield capacity in Maharashtra, and acquiring a 50% equity stake in Thriveni Pellets for a consideration of₹636 crore.

Vaqarjaved Khan, Senior Fundamental Analyst, Angel One, said a more realistic Nifty 50 target of 28,500–30,000 is likely in 2026, implying 10–15% returns, largely driven by earnings growth in sectors such as banking, telecom, autos, healthcare, and defence, rather than multiple expansion.
The rally is unlikely to be linear and would be marked by phases of consolidation, cautioned analysts.
Emkay Global's Sen sees Nifty target of around 29,000 over the next 12 months, implying low double-digit upside. Any meaningful correction should be viewed as a buying opportunity, supported by improving earnings visibility from the second half of the year and a stable macro backdrop, he added.
Unlike 2025, the 2026 rally is expected to be more inclusive, lifting the broader indices alongside the Nifty and Sensex, said Meena. Global uncertainties, including potential US tariffs, slowing global growth, and evolving Fed policy, are likely to remain risks to the rally.

Even though there will be no salary hike for central government employees, once the central government fully implements the 8th CPC, they will receive arrears for the period starting from 1 January 2026. This is expected to enhance the spending limit for central government employees and pensioners, who number around one crore. Such a rise in the spending limit of central government employees may fuel liquidity in the Indian economy, which is a good development for India.""
Highlighting the benefit of higher salaries of the central government employees, Seema Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities, said, ""A substantial upward revision in salaries, allowances and pensions for central government employees and pensioners would directly translate into higher disposable incomes, improved consumption sentiment and stronger household savings.""
On the impact of the 8th Pay Commission on the Indian stock market, Seema Srivastava of SMC Global Securities, said, ""From a capital market perspective, this creates a favourable backdrop for earnings visibility, liquidity inflows and risk appetite, particularly at a time when India’s growth remains relatively insulated from global macro volatility. Historically, pay commission implementations have led to a multi-quarter consumption upcycle, which equity markets tend to discount well in advance, benefiting consumption-linked sectors disproportionately."" She said that banks and NBFCs will be major beneficiaries, as central government employees' and pensioners' bank deposits are expected to increase after the salary and pension hike due to the 8th Pay Commission.
Asked about the sectors that may benefit most from the 8th Pay Commission, Seema said, ""In terms of sectoral impact, the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be consumer discretionary and consumption-driven sectors. Automobiles (especially entry-level and mid-segment passenger vehicles, two-wheelers and tractors), consumer durables, electronics, retail, FMCG (premiumisation-led categories), housing-related segments (cement, building materials, paints, fittings), and affordable real estate are expected to see a sustained demand boost.""
“The 8th Pay Commission could act as a structural liquidity booster for domestic capital markets, reinforcing India’s strong domestic investor base and reducing dependence on volatile foreign flows. So, capital goods, infrastructure and services sectors could also benefit indirectly as higher consumption improves overall economic activity and government tax collections.”
According to Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda, the 8th Pay Commission is expected in FY2027-28 or even as late as FY2028-29.
“The Union Cabinet approved the formation of the 8th Pay Commission and its Terms of Reference (ToR) in early to mid-2025 (official notifications were released around November 2025). The commission is typically given 18 months to submit its detailed report. While the effective date of the hike is 1 January 2026, the actual final announcement of the new salary slabs is expected in late 2026 or early 2027,” as per Rohit Jain, managing partner at Singhania & Co.

In an interview with Mint, he says he expects healthy earnings in Q3 FY26. ""Benchmark Nifty 50 and Nifty 500 may deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth in Q3,"" he says. Moreover, he also shares insights on the equity investment strategy for 2026.
We feel that Indian equities will do well in 2026, though it will not be a broad-based rally as several pockets of overvaluation exist in the market.
From a macro perspective, the Indian economy is in a very healthy state entering 2026.
In 2025, three important developments in the form of income tax cuts, GST reductions, and a significant decline in interest rates provided meaningful support to the economy.
These measures together should drive strong earnings from Q3FY26 and drive a rebound in the performance of Indian equities.
However, some sectors/stocks with frothy valuations will not do well, so sound stock selection will be key to enjoying healthy returns.
Earnings growth should rebound meaningfully from Q3FY26, driven by multiple factors like GST & income tax rate cuts, low interest rates, as well as the low base of the same quarter last financial year.
We expect benchmark indices like Nifty 50 and Nifty 500 to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth.
In Q3FY25, revenue growth had hit a 16-quarter low for Nifty 50 (4.5% YoY) and a 5-quarter low for Nifty 500 (4.6% YoY), so the base is favourably low for Q2FY26.
Infra spending by the government has grown meaningfully year-on-year in Q3FY26, which should help the capital goods and infra sectors.
Supportive measures by the RBI, such as multiple interest rate cuts and improved liquidity from CRR cuts, have helped boost credit growth, consumption, and other economic indicators.
However, the earnings growth will not be very broad-based as some sectors are expected to meaningfully outperform.
Certain sectors like auto and auto ancillaries, power equipment, banks, mid/small cap IT/ITES are expected to outperform in 2026.
The auto sector has probably been the biggest beneficiary of both GST and interest rate cuts, as meaningful price cuts have improved affordability, while lower EMIs also help drive purchases.
This is already showing up in strong auto sales growth reported for October and November.
Auto ancillaries, especially, are benefitting from the premiumisation trend in the Indian auto industry over and above factors like GST / bank interest/income tax rate cuts.
Power equipment like transformers, diesel gensets, smart meters, other generators, etc, are witnessing multi-year structural tailwinds due to factors like global grid modernisation, burgeoning power demand from data centre capacity addition, need for huge transmission capacity addition due to renewable generation capacity addition, etc.
Select IT / ITES companies are also expected to continue doing well in 2026, driven by their strength and focus on AI, which is witnessing strong spending by enterprises.
Lastly, banks are expected to do well in 2026 as it is one of the most reasonably valued sectors currently.
Also, bank earnings should improve from Q2FY6 due to improving credit growth on the back of multiple liquidity measures from the RBI, as well as margin improvement due to lower cost of funding.
In 2026, investors should be selective in their stock selection, especially avoiding companies with frothy valuations as well as those that have poor cash generation due to factors like a stretched working capital cycle.
The focus should be on companies with attractive financials in sectors mentioned above that have a good growth outlook for 2026, but are available at reasonable valuations.
Contrary to the current popular belief that small and mid-cap companies are expensive, there is a large set of 3,000+ listed companies beyond the large cap space (top 100 companies by market cap) in which several niche, fast-growing companies are available now at attractive valuations.
Our belief is that investors should not look at valuations of benchmark small / mid-cap indices, and not blindly follow the current narrative painting all small/micro caps as expensive.
In the broader space of companies beyond the top 250 market cap companies, there has been a significant drawdown from all-time highs, and several good businesses are available at attractive valuations.

The broader trend, however, continues to favour precious metals, with silver remaining the standout performer after an exceptional rally last year.
Gold and silver delivered stellar gains in 2025, according to MCX data. Domestic spot gold surged₹56,727, or 75%, rising from₹75,913 per 10 grams on December 31, 2024, to₹1,32,640 per 10 grams on December 31, 2025. Silver outpaced gold significantly, jumping₹1,43,601, or 167%, from₹85,851 per kg to₹2,29,452 per kg over the same period.
In global markets, gold prices recorded their strongest annual gain since 1979, rising 66% in 2025, while silver logged its best year ever, soaring 165%. The rally was driven by US Federal Reserve rate cuts and expectations of further easing, sustained central bank buying, rising ETF inflows, and heightened geopolitical uncertainty. Silver also benefited from additional tailwinds, including strong industrial demand from electric vehicles, solar power, semiconductors, and data centres, combined with tight supply conditions.
Highlighting silver’s relative valuation, Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives and Research at SAMCO Securities, said, “Silver prices have historically traded at 2–3% of gold prices. In 2025, silver traded at just 0.95% of gold prices, while currently it is around 1.65%, indicating there is still significant scope for catch-up after years of repression.” He added that growing interest from central banks such as Saudi Arabia, along with rising industrial demand from semiconductors, solar panels and EVs, supports further upside in silver even from current levels.
Sharing a technical outlook, Aakash Shah, Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking, said gold’s strong rally of over 65%, which pushed prices beyond₹1,40,000 per 10 grams domestically and saw spot prices peak near $4,550, has opened targets of $4,400–$5,000, equivalent to₹1,46,700–₹1,55,000. He added that silver, after breaching $83 spot (around₹2,54,000 per kg) and posting a 120% annual surge, is positioned to potentially outperform gold further, with key support seen at₹2,11,600–₹1,80,000 and resistance in the₹2,60,000–₹2,95,000 zone.

The development was disclosed in an exchange filing following a board meeting held on Wednesday, December 31, 2025.
As per the approved structure,₹2,307 crore will be infused in cash over the next 12 months, while the remaining₹3,529 crore will be raised by the promoters through the sale of equity shares held by certain Vodafone Group shareholders.
“We wish to inform you that the company has reached an agreement with the Vodafone group and entered into an amendment agreement dated 31 December 2025 to the Implementation Agreement dated 20 March 2017, as amended with its promoter/promoter group shareholders,” Vodafone Idea said in its regulatory filing.
The company also clarified that part of the contingent liability adjustment mechanism has been secured through 328 crore equity shares pledged by certain Vodafone Group shareholders for a period of five years.
Vodafone Idea further noted that during the 2018 Vodafone India–Idea merger, the former promoters had agreed to settle cash flow obligations related to disputes originating prior to May 31, 2018. The latest funding arrangement builds on those earlier commitments as the company works to stabilise its finances.
“Of the AGR dues that Vodafone Idea owes to the government, annual payments of₹18,000 crore were supposed to start in March 2026,” the matter noted, adding that the company had approached the Supreme Court, warning that the absence of relief could threaten its financial stability and the government’s stake in the telco.
Under the revised framework, AGR dues frozen as of December 31 will be repaid between FY32 and FY41, while dues for FY18 and FY19 will continue to be paid between FY26 and FY31 without any change. The frozen AGR amount will also be reassessed by the Department of Telecommunications, with the outcome to be decided by a government-appointed committee and binding on both parties. Queries sent to the DoT remained unanswered until publication.
Vodafone Idea, one of India’s three privately owned telecom operators, remains central to the government’s intent of preserving a three-player telecom market, though its fragile financial position continues to raise concerns about long-term sustainability.",5

In such an environment, the question for investors is no longer where growth exists; it is how to capitalise on it. It is whether growth is still visible and believable. This is exactly where management guidance begins to matter. Companies that are willing to put numbers on the table.
More importantly, companies that are guiding revenue growth of up to 40% for FY26 offer a clearer window into how they see demand, profitability growth and capacity shaping up over the next year.
Netweb Technologies India, an IT player, designs and manufactures high-end computing systems. These power complex workloads across high-performance computing, private cloud and artificial intelligence. This is a capability-led business, where design depth and execution matter more than volumes.
Netweb has reiterated its 35–40% revenue growth guidance for FY26. Apart from the strong growth number, what stands out is the confidence with which management has stuck to this range even after factoring in large strategic orders.
The company expects growth to come from core demand across AI systems, private cloud, and high-performance computing, rather than from one-off execution spikes.
Its H1FY26 revenue grew 51.1% YoY, on the back of strong order inflows. Ebitda margins came in at 14.9%, up from 14.1% in the year-ago period, led by operating leverage and a better mix, even as the AI-related business scaled up. The AI segment’s contribution to revenue rose, highlighting how quickly demand for AI-led systems is building.
Looking ahead, Netweb expects this momentum to carry forward. Moreover, the recently announced strategic orders can be executed without incremental capex, as existing manufacturing and integration capacities are sufficient.
The stock trades at a premium to its long-term median valuation. The next leg will depend on how consistently execution keeps pace with expectation.
Genus Power Infrastructures operates in the power metering segment. The company enjoys a strong presence in smart electricity meters and metering services.
Genus Power has increased its FY26 revenue forecast. It is now aiming to generate a total revenue of₹4,500 crore. The company has also guided for Ebitda margins of around 20%.
The guidance is visible in the H1FY26 numbers. Revenue grew 132% in comparison to the same period last year. This was the result of a sharp ramp-up in smart meter installations. Operating Ebitda margins were stronger at 21.2%, up from 17.1% in the year-ago period, thanks to operating leverage, cost control and better absorption of fixed costs as volumes scaled.
Looking ahead, the business visibility is healthy. As of September 2025, the order book stood at₹28,700 crore. As more projects go live, management expects working capital intensity to ease gradually over the next few quarters.
The company is adding capacity to support higher throughput, while capex remains focused on execution readiness rather than aggressive expansion.
Currently, the shares of Genus Power trade at a premium to its long-term median valuation. From here, the focus shifts to whether execution stays on track as scale increases and margins settle closer to guided levels.
Waaree Renewable Technologies operates in the solar EPC space. It is a business where execution matters more than capacity. Project management, procurement discipline and on-ground coordination largely determine outcomes.
The company has not given a formal revenue growth guidance for FY26. However, the H1FY26 results and a healthy unexecuted order book and steady order inflows continue to support confidence around near-term growth.
H1FY26 revenue grew 81.1% over the same period last year. This was driven by a sharp acceleration in project execution. Operating Ebitda margins expanded, with Q2 FY26 margins at 20.4% compared with 13.7% a year ago, thanks to operating leverage and cost control.
Management has indicated that while quarterly margins can fluctuate, it is comfortable with Ebitda margins of around 15% at a full-year level.
Looking ahead, momentum is expected to carry forward. The unexecuted order book at 3.48 GWp is to be executed over the next 12–15 months. Incremental growth does not require heavy capex.
The EPC business remains asset-light, funded through internal accruals, milestone-based payments and disciplined working capital management. Select IPP additions have been approved, but EPC execution continues to be the primary growth engine.
At present, the stock trades at a premium to its long-term median valuation. From here, delivery consistency will matter more than headline growth numbers.
Krishna Defence and Allied Industries operates in a narrow but important part of the defence supply chain. It produces specialised steel sections, weld consumables, and components that are used in naval platforms and armoured systems.
The company is aiming to grow at 30–40% over the next few years. This confidence comes from the platforms it is already part of rather than from near-term order announcements. Management has repeatedly stressed that visibility comes from understanding long-cycle naval programmes, not from reading too much into quarterly order book movements.
That approach shows up in the numbers as well. H1 FY26 revenue grew 28.1% YoY. Operating EBITDA margins moved up to 17.9% from 15.0% a year ago. This came from operating leverage and better productivity as volumes increased, rather than from any meaningful shift in product mix.
Looking ahead, the company entered the second half with an order book of₹190 crore. Krishna Defence has completed its recent capacity expansion, which is now fully operational. Growth from here is expected to come more from higher throughput than from adding new assets.
The stock trades at a premium to its long-term median valuation. From here, the story hinges less on fresh announcements and more on whether execution continues to quietly compound.
Shakti Pumps is best known for solar pumps. The company’s operations includes government-linked schemes, exports and a growing retail footprint.
The company is guiding for an average of 20–25% revenue growth in FY26. This guidance comes despite weather-related disruptions and delays linked to extended monsoons.
In H1 FY26, the company reported a revenue growth of a mere 7% YoY, impacted by slower execution during the extended monsoon period. Even so, profitability held up well.
Operating Ebitda margins for H1 FY26 stood at 21.7%, while Q2 FY26 margins came in at 20.4%. The moderation in quarterly margins came from higher raw material costs. Management has been clear that this guidance remains unchanged, with growth expected to be back-ended as execution accelerates in the second half of the year. It also reiterated its full-year margin guidance as operating leverage improves.
Looking ahead, the company is banking on its order book of₹1300 crore as of early November. Execution momentum is to pick up as weather disruptions fade and delayed installations resume. Capex remains a key part of the longer-term story.
The company is in the middle of a capacity expansion and a 2.2 GW solar cell and module project. The total planned capex is around₹1200 crore over the next 18 months. This is expected to be funded through a mix of internal accruals, recent equity raising and incremental debt.
The stock trades at a premium to its long-term median valuation. From here, the focus shifts to how smoothly execution picks up in the second half and whether the company delivers on its full-year growth and margin guidance.
In a market where valuations leave little room for error, growth needs to be backed by steady execution and profitability. Revenue guidance, especially in the 20–40% range, sets a high bar. It reflects not just ambition, but also management’s assessment of demand visibility, capacity readiness and balance sheet strength.
That said, guidance is only the starting point. What matters over time is whether companies deliver quarter after quarter, without stretching balance sheets or compromising margins. Midcap stocks can reward investors handsomely when execution compounds. However, they can also disappoint when expectations outpace reality.
For investors, the task is to stay grounded. Look beyond price momentum, track operating performance closely and pay attention to how management commentary evolves as the year progresses. In an expensive market, selectivity matters more than conviction.

""In 2025, bonds started being discussed less as a static yield instrument and more as an active, tradable part of India’s capital markets."" In an interview with Mint, Goenka underscored that increased tariffs, volatility in oil and other commodity prices and any stress in the NBFC sector due to slower economic growth are the key risks for bond markets. Here are edited excerpts of the interview:
2025 helped shift bonds from an 'institution-only' product to a more widely used 'retail-friendly' portfolio allocation.
That change is visible in secondary market activity: FY25 saw nearly 11.9 lakh corporate bond trades, and by November 2025, trade counts had already crossed nearly 16.2 lakh — a new high.
In effect, bonds started being discussed less as a static yield instrument and more as an active, tradable part of India’s capital markets.
With a 125 bps repo rate cut by the RBI, the short-term bonds enjoyed healthy gains.
India’s capex cycle needs long-tenor capital that matches project cash flows, and corporate bonds are increasingly filling that role alongside banks.
Bonds offer issuers flexibility on tenor and structure, while an expanding domestic investor base improves funding reliability.
As secondary liquidity improves, price discovery and refinancing confidence also strengthen—supporting capex at scale.
In fact, corporate credit has seen steady growth in non-banking funding via capital markets.
The RBI’s stance matters as much through expectations and liquidity as through the repo rate itself.
When the RBI signals a controlled easing bias—or even a dovish pause—it helps prevent disorderly moves at the long end, and that stabilises term funding for issuers.
But the real link is transmission. Rate cuts help only if the long end of the government curve stays contained—because that’s the reference point for corporate pricing and refinancing.
Hence, although the 0-3 years maturity bonds have gained from cuts, longer term rates have remained sticky at higher levels, discouraging corporate funding for longer duration.
Higher US and Japan yields can reprice global risk, trigger volatility, and temporarily tighten financial conditions for emerging markets.
For India, the impact is often most visible through sentiment rather than any direct impact, as we are more of a domestic demand-led bond market.
The data already tells us the market is accelerating, but depth is still uneven, and liquidity remains concentrated. Hence, the next leg of growth through policy has to be engineered.
Some key changes would be: (1) establishing a regulatory uniform distribution code for bonds much like equities and mutual funds, (2) right framework for market making in corporate bonds to enhance liquidity, (3) roll back of TDS on listed bonds as they are operationally challenging and distort XIRR calculations, and (4) tax equalisation or simplification with other asset classes such as equities.
Interest rates are likely to remain unchanged, with no possibility of another rate cut in 2026. Hence, overall, a very benign environment for fixed income investing.
Key risks in 2026 can include global geopolitical shocks such as more tariff drama, commodity pricing volatility, especially oil and any stress in the NBFC sector due to slower economic growth.
Treat a bond like what it is: a loan to a company. Don’t chase the headline yield—stick to regulated, listed, rated bonds, read the key covenants, diversify across issuers, and keep high yield as the “spicy” portion—not the whole plate—because liquidity and risk show up when markets get stressed.
A portfolio approach to fixed income is encouraged with a combination of high-yield 2-3 year maturity corporate bonds and long-maturity government or PSU bonds.

With all major markets shut for the New Year holiday, traders said Thursday’s session was likely to see thin volumes and limited price discovery, and expect a largely flat opening for the rupee and range-bound trade.
The rupee had settled at 89.87 on the last trading day of 2025, registering a decline of nearly 5% over the year. Last month, the currency declined by 0.46%, trading in a wide 89.25 to 91.0750 range.
In December, the Reserve Bank of India initially allowed the rupee to weaken before stepping in aggressively to support the currency.
The central bank’s heavy dollar sales flushed out long-dollar positions and reasserted its hold on price action.
In recent sessions, the rupee has settled into a narrow band, with the 90 level proving to be a support that traders say may represent a soft line of defence for the RBI.
""There will be conflicting forces at play in the near-term. I would say the underlying flows are still unsupportive (for rupee) and on the other side is RBI,"" a currency trader said.
Outside of domestic flows, the key focus for the rupee and its Asian peers will be the dollar index, which had a difficult 2025, sliding 9.4%.
The performance of the U.S. economy, along with the number of rate cuts delivered by the Federal Reserve this year, is expected to be key for the dollar in 2026, analysts said.",6

On the sectoral front, automobile stocks will remain in focus as companies begin reporting December sales numbers, which will be closely monitored for confirmation of sectoral momentum. The data will be key in assessing whether the strong demand traction seen after the recent GST rationalisation is being sustained.
Speaking on the outlook of the Nifty 50 index, Vaishali Parekh said, “The Nifty 50 index, once again sustaining the important 50-DEMA zone near the 25,850 level, regained the upward move with bias improving and as the day progressed, gained strength almost to touch the 26,200 level. The index closed near the 26130 level, with a trend revival visible. We can anticipate a further rise, as important support is positioned near the 25850 level, as mentioned earlier. The index would need to move past the 26200 zone to establish conviction and thereafter, expect to continue with the upward move to trigger for fresh breakout in the coming days.”
On the outlook of the Bank Nifty index, Parekh said, “The Bank Nifty index surged ahead with most of the PSU Banks performing and closed near the 59,600 zone with bias once again improving and as said earlier, would need a decisive breakout above the tough resistance barrier of the 59,800 zone to trigger a fresh upward move in the coming days. Important support is maintained near the 58,700 zone, and with the overall bias remaining optimistic, further gains are expected with the beginning of a new year.”
Parekh stated that immediate support for the Nifty 50 index is located at 26,000, while the resistance level is at 26,300. The Bank Nifty is expected to have a daily range of 59,200 to 60,000.
The stock is showing some signs of a trend reversal, and we expect strong buying in it.
The banking stock is close to its support level, which is expected to remain intact. We expect some bounce back in Yes Bank shares.
The stock is looking positive on the chart pattern and showcasing a new bullish round momentum.

Highlighting the market performance data, the report stated, Nifty 50 index rose by 10.5 per cent between December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025. The index closed at 23,645 on December 31, 2024 and climbed to 26,130 by December 31, 2025, registering a gain of 2,485 points during the period.
This made Nifty 50 the best-performing major equity index on the NSE in the last one year.
In comparison, other key indices posted relatively lower returns. The Nifty Next 50 index showed a modest rise of 2.0 per cent, gaining 1,376 points to end at 69,365 as against 67,988 a year ago.
Nifty 50 USD increased by 5.3 per cent, moving from 9,570 to 10,081 during the same period, reflecting the impact of currency movement on dollar-denominated returns.
The broader market indices also recorded positive but lower growth than the benchmark. Nifty 500 advanced by 6.7 per cent, rising from 22,375 to 23,872, while Nifty Midcap 150 moved up by 5.4 per cent, increasing from 21,141 to 22,277 over the one-year period.
However, the small-cap segment underperformed during the year. The Nifty Smallcap 250 index declined by 6.0 per cent, falling from 17,752 on December 31, 2024 to 16,685 on December 31, 2025, marking a drop of 1,068 points.
The Nifty Total Market index, which represents the overall market performance, gained 6.0 per cent during the year. It rose from 12,633 to 13,394, adding 760 points.
Currency and global indicators also showed notable movement. The USD-INR rate increased from 85.6 to 89.9, indicating a depreciation of the rupee by 5.0 per cent during the year. Meanwhile, the Dollar Index declined sharply by 9.4 per cent, falling from 108.5 to 98.2, reflecting a weakening of the US dollar against major global currencies.
Market capitalisation indicators also pointed to growth in the equity market. The total market capitalisation of NSE-listed companies rose from₹439 lakh crore at the end of December 2024 to₹474 lakh crore by December 31, 2025, marking an increase of 7.9 per cent during the year.
However, the market capitalisation to GDP ratio declined from 138 per cent to 135 per cent, indicating a moderation of 279 basis points. (ANI)",6

The real-time COMEX silver price is quoting $70.896 per ounce, 0.11% lower than the previous day's close. MCX silver rates finished marginally higher on Wednesday; however, the white metal in the domestic market is still around₹18,000 away from the record high of₹2,54,174 per kg.
According to experts, COMEX silver has immediate support placed at $69.70. If the white metal breaks below this support, it may attempt to test the $67 and $65 levels in the international market soon. They said that the MCX silver rate today has immediate support placed at₹2,32,000. On breaking below this immediate support, the precious bullion may attempt to approach its crucial support, placed around the₹2,22,000 to₹2,20,000 per kg band. However, they expect a flat trade session for the white metal, as MCX silver rates and the COMEX silver prices are taking cues from the Shanghai silver price movement. As the Shanghai Stock Exchange is closed today for the New Year 2026 celebrations, there will be no movement in the Shanghai silver price today.
Speaking on the outlook of MCX silver rates, Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money, said, “Despite the near-term pressure, the longer-term bullish framework remains intact. Prices are finding initial support near the rising channel and the 20-day EMA around₹2,08,994, with deeper declines continuing to attract accumulation interest. A sustained rebound above₹2,36,000 could trigger fresh upside toward₹2,45,000 to₹2,60,000 over the medium term. The broader trend continues to favour accumulation on dips.”
The silver market in 2025 has undergone a structural transformation that goes far beyond a simple bull rally. It reflects a fracture between paper pricing and physical scarcity, driven largely by inventory depletion, policy shifts, tightening global supply, and rising demand from both safe-haven investors and industrial users.
Silver prices recently hit record levels above $75 on COMEX and above₹2.3 lakh on the domestic front—representing gains of over 160%—underscoring the global nature of the squeeze and persistent demand pressures.
This is not random volatility; it is the culmination of years of supply deficits and intensifying physical demand that have exposed systemic weaknesses in how silver markets are priced and traded.
Highlighting silver’s relative valuation, Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives and Research at SAMCO Securities, said, “Silver prices have historically traded at 2–3% of gold prices. In 2025, silver traded at just 0.95% of gold prices, while currently it is around 1.65%, indicating there is still significant scope for catch-up after years of repression.” He added that growing interest from central banks such as Saudi Arabia, along with rising industrial demand from semiconductors, solar panels and EVs, supports further upside in silver even from current levels.
“During the Christmas holiday period, when Western benchmark markets such as COMEX and LBMA were closed, silver prices continued to trade actively in Asia. The result was a striking divergence: physical silver in Shanghai surged close to USD 82, while COMEX prices were trading significantly lower. It highlights a growing disconnect between paper-based price discovery and the real conditions of physical supply and demand,” said Sugandha Sachdeva.
“In the absence of any major triggers from global markets, movements in the Indian rupee against the US dollar are likely to remain the primary driver of gold and silver prices on domestic exchanges,” said Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money.
Expecting high volatility in silver rates across bourses, Sugandha Sachdeva of SS WealthStreet, said, “Shanghai silver price is expected to remain volatile as we witnessed on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, Indian investors should remain vigilant about key levels. MCX silver rate today has important support placed at the₹2,32,000 to₹2,30,000 band. On breaking below this support, MCX silver rates may try to touch₹2,22,000 to₹2,20,000 band.”
“MCX and other global bourses are closely following the Shanghai silver price movement these days. As the Shanghai Stock Exchange is open today, I am expecting high volatility in the silver rates on Friday,” said Sugandha Sachdeva, founder of SS WealthStreet.
“With global participation largely absent, any intraday moves should be viewed as liquidity driven rather than reflective of underlying fundamentals, with normal volumes and clearer directional cues expected to return from January 2, 2026,” said Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money.
After a gap-up opening, MCX silver lost its early morning gains and touched an intraday low of₹2,33,850 per kg. However, the white metal pared these losses and is currently trading at₹2,35,365 per kg,₹336 lower from yesterday's close.
“Recycling offers little relief. Unlike gold, silver is embedded in minute quantities across millions of devices-smartphones, solar panels, electronics, medical equipment-making recovery uneconomic at prevailing prices. Once silver is used industrially, it is effectively consumed, permanently removed from the accessible supply pool,” said Sugandha.
Silver mining cannot respond quickly to price signals. Bringing a new mine into production typically takes seven to ten years, encompassing permitting, feasibility studies, capital deployment, infrastructure build-out, and workforce development. Even projects currently underway are unlikely to add meaningful supply before 2027,"" Sugandha Sachdeva of SS WealthStreet added.
“The supply side is structurally broken. Despite materially higher prices over the past two years, global silver mine output remains flat. This is not cyclical; it is structural,” said Sugandha Sachdeva of SS WealthStreet.
“Silver has shifted from the hands of paper traders to physical delivery.  This transfer from weak hands to strong hands is pivotal. Once it reaches critical mass, market structure changes-and pricing power shifts decisively to physical buyers. In October alone, China exported a record 660 tonnes of gold, the largest single-month outflow on record. When visible inventories are drained at this pace, prices do not adjust gradually-they gap higher,” said Sugandha Sachdeva of SS WealthStreet.
“The metal has not vanished; it has migrated from paper traders who rarely take delivery to industrial users who must secure supply to keep production lines running, to long-term investors and private vaults across Asia, London, and Singapore, away from exchange warehouses and outside the banking system,” Sugandha Sachdeva of SS WealthStreet said.
Speaking on the outlook of COMEX silver price, Anuj Gupta, Director at Ya Wealth, said, “The COMEX silver has immediate support placed at $69.70. If the white metal breaks below this support, it may attempt to test the $67 and $65 levels in the international market soon.”
According to Reuters, silver prices soared to record highs, propelled by its inclusion on the U.S.' critical minerals list, supply constraints and low inventories amid rising industrial and investment demand.
After a gap-up opening during the Opening Bell, MCX silver rates extended early gains. MCX silver rate is currently quoting₹2,35,904 per kg,₹203 higher than the previous day's close.
According to Reuters, China on Tuesday named the companies that will be able to export tungsten, antimony, and silver during the 2026 and 2027 periods, metals Beijing deems critical to support its own industries.  A total of 44 companies will be allowed to export silver, while the numbers for tungsten and antimony will be 15 and 11, respectively, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. That's two more than in 2025 for silver, while tungsten and antimony are unchanged.
“As long as $70.40 holds, the trend remains corrective rather than bearish. A break below $70.40 could trigger a short-term reversal toward $65, while a decisive move above $78.67 would invalidate the bearish setup and signal trend continuation toward fresh highs. Volatility is expected to remain elevated within this range,” said Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money.
Amid no cues from the Shanghai silver price, MCX silver is trading flat during the Opening Bell. MCX silver rate today opened marginally higher at₹2,35,998 per kg and touched an intraday high of₹2,38,911 per kg . However, the precious white metal failed to sustain at higher levels and came under the profit-taking pressure. Currently, MCX silver rate is quoting₹2,35,766 per kg,₹65 higher than the previous day's close.
Expecting a strong bounce back once the Chinese paper silver play evapourates, Sugandha Sachdeva, founder of SS WealthStreet said, “Silver’s sharp 178% rally this year marks a decisive structural turning point, not a speculative blow-off. The price action reflects a global repricing driven by acute physical scarcity, rapidly expanding industrial demand, ongoing monetary dilution, and a clear shift of price discovery toward Asia, particularly China. Crucially, this rally is being led by deliverable metal demand, not by leveraged futures positioning.”
“The correction has been driven primarily by CME margin hikes, forced deleveraging, year-end tax harvesting, and thin liquidity conditions, keeping near-term sentiment cautious despite the intact broader trend,” said Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money.
As we enter the New Year 2026, the Chinese restrictions on silver export, banning those exports who don't have government license, is expected to play its role in the movement of silver rates today. The Chinese move is expected to impact silver prices on COMEX and other bourses too.
“These days, MCX and other global bourses are following Shanghai silver price movement very closely. As the Shanghai Stock Exchange is closed today for the New Year 2026, MCX silver price is expected trade flat in the early morning session, ” said Anuj Gupta, Director at Ya Wealth.
Speaking on the outlook of MCX silver rates, Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money, said, “Despite the near-term pressure, the longer-term bullish framework remains intact.""
""MCX silver rate finding initial support near the rising channel and the 20-day EMA around₹2,08,994, with deeper declines continuing to attract accumulation interest. A sustained rebound above₹2,36,000 could trigger fresh upside toward₹2,45,000 to₹2,60,000 over the medium term. The broader trend continues to favour accumulation on dips,” said Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money.
The MCX silver rates finished marginally higher on Wednesday at around₹2,36,000 per kg levels. However, this price discovery a the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) is still more than₹18,000 away from the record high of₹2,54,174.",-1

Most global markets are closed today on account of New Year.
Indian equities ended the last session of 2025 on a positive note, supported by healthy buying across segments as short covering emerged. Sentiment improved on hopes that the year ahead would see better earnings growth, progress on an India–US trade agreement, and renewed participation from foreign investors. The Sensex advanced 546 points, or 0.64%, to close at 85,220.60, while the Nifty 50 climbed 191 points, or 0.74%, to finish at 26,129.60.

Meanwhile, the oil & gas sector outperformed on the back of anticipated stable demand and stronger refining margins,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited.
Hong Kong stocks wrapped up 2025 with a second consecutive year of gains, marking their strongest annual performance in percentage terms since 2017, as an AI-led rally buoyed investor sentiment. The Hang Seng Index finished the year up 28%, ranking among the best-performing equity markets in Asia.
Mainland Chinese equities also delivered solid gains. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 18%, its best annual showing since 2019, after touching its highest closing level in a decade in August.
Meanwhile, the Shenzhen Composite Index advanced 29%, while the technology-heavy ChiNext Price Index jumped 50%. Most Asian markets are closed today for the New Year holiday.
The trends on Gift Nifty indicated a flat but positive start for the Indian benchmark index. The Gift Nifty was trading at a new high of 26,341, up 66 points or 0.25% from the Nifty futures’ previous close.
Wall Street closed out another banner year for stocks Wednesday with a downbeat finish that extended the market’s recent losing streak to a fourth day.
The S&P 500 gave up 0.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% and the Nasdaq composite closed 0.8% lower. Trading volume was very thin ahead of the New Year’s Day holiday, when markets will be closed, as most big investors have already closed out their positions for the year.
Even with their mini post-Christmas pullback, the major U.S. stock indexes finished with strong gains for the year.
The United States Department of the Treasury on Wednesday (local time) imposed sanctions on four companies operating in Venezuela's oil sector and identified four oil tankers as blocked property, according to an official release.
The move is part of President Donald Trump's renewed efforts to increase pressure on the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
The sanctions announced on Wednesday are aimed at four companies and their linked oil tankers, which are accused of being involved in the transport of Venezuelan oil.
The dollar edged slightly higher but stayed on track for a year-on-year decline, pressured by interest rate cuts, fiscal concerns and President Donald Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.01% to 98.25. The euro was up 0.02% at $1.1748.
West Texas Intermediate slipped 0.9% to settle at $57.42 a barrel, marking a roughly 20% fall for the year. In the near term, traders are watching an upcoming OPEC meeting along with US President Donald Trump’s policy stance toward major producers such as Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",6

However, expectations of further interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve later this year helped cap the downside for the yellow metal.
Around 10 am, MCX gold February futures were trading 0.13% lower at₹1,35,267 per 10 grams, while MCX silver March contracts were up 0.06% at₹2,35,842 per kg.
Despite the intraday softness, gold and silver delivered exceptional gains in 2025. According to MCX data, domestic spot gold surged₹56,727, or 75%, per 10 grams during the year, rising from₹75,913 per 10 grams on December 31, 2024, to₹1,32,640 per 10 grams on December 31, 2025.
In the international market, gold prices recorded their largest annual gain since 1979, climbing 66% in 2025, underscoring the strength of the global rally.
The surge in precious metals last year was driven by US Federal Reserve rate cuts and expectations of further policy easing, strong central bank buying, and rising inflows into exchange-traded funds, amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty. Commenting on gold’s performance, Sugandha Sachdeva, Founder of SS WealthStreet, said, “Gold has displayed exceptional resilience throughout the year, recording declines of more than 3% on only two occasions—May 12 and December 29, 2025. Since October 2023, prices have risen for nine consecutive quarters, and in 2025 alone, 11 out of 12 months closed in positive territory, underscoring the depth and durability of the uptrend.”
Looking ahead to 2026, the key question is whether central banks’ sustained gold purchases can uphold valuations if a technical reset emerges. Nevertheless, the underlying drivers — inflation, currency weakness, and geopolitical uncertainty—remain strong enough to overcome any correction, keeping gold prices anchored in the USD 4,500–5,000 range, said Rajeev Sharan, Head – Criteria, Model Development & Research, Brickwork Ratings.
Gold and Silver surged over the past year on the back of a powerful mix of macro stress, structural demand, monetary policy changes, and overall unrest. Meanwhile, silver, along with safe haven buying was also supported by industrial demand and physical tightness. We continue to believe these factors along with change in BOJ’s policy, change in Fed governor and ripple effect of tariff’s could be possible themes impacting bullion in 2026. ETF inflows could remain influential, while speculative positioning and macro drivers such as currency dynamics, and global growth prospects will dictate shorter‑term trends.
We suggest reducing the mix on Gold & Silver to 5%, suggests Geojit. It added that Gold and silver emerged as the top-performing assets in CY25, driven by USD depreciation after tariff hikes and the Fed’s halt of quantitative tightening (QT).
According to Ventura, the runway is set for the Year 2026 to have an extended rally in Gold. The cocktail could be powered by the Central bank buying, stubborn inflation, widening US deficits and concerns around the US economy and tariffs. The expectations of 75 bps FED rate cuts could keep the gold bid going. Gold's bullish story is still unfolding and possibly far from over. As a hedge against inflation institutional investors could chip in, followed by the retail and speculators participation in the market volatility seeking safety. This could result in an expected price range of $4600 - $4800
The current gold price in Mumbai stands at₹13,588 per gram for 24-karat gold (commonly known as 999 gold) and₹12,455 per gram for 22-karat gold.
The import duty cuts on gold and silver from 15% to 6% should have catalysed consumption; however, the unchanged 3% GST continues to limit retail demand. Meanwhile, 50% US tariffs on jewellery exports create headwinds that lower import tariffs cannot fully offset. India’s copper demand is poised to accelerate as data centre capacity expands to 4–8 GW by 2030, said Rajeev Sharan, Head – Criteria, Model Development & Research, Brickwork Ratings.
The current gold price in Chennai stands at₹13,691 per gram for 24-karat gold (commonly known as 999 gold) and₹12,550 per gram for 22-karat gold.
The current gold price in Delhi stands at₹13,603 per gram for 24-karat gold (commonly known as 999 gold) and₹12,470 per gram for 22-karat gold.
We believe that we are in the middle of a grand monetary reset where gold is playing a crucial role. Gold is no longer only a hedge against inflation. It is an anchor asset in a monetary regime change. The trust in dollar was shaken after the US & EU confiscated Russian assets post its Ukraine invasion. Central banks across the world have reduced their US treasury holdings. Central banks’ gold holdings have exceeded their US Treasury holdings for the first time in 2025. Gold prices gained momentum as ETFs inflows also pushed the prices higher. Gold vaults are opening up across the world in China, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Central Asia. Gold is increasingly being used as settlement asset outside the dollar system. We believe all of this is going to push the gold prices higher in 2026.
Gold and silver are set to sustain their rally into 2026, propelled by robust central bank purchases such as China's 400+ tonnes in 2025 and silver's deepening supply deficits amid surging EV and solar demand, alongside macroeconomic supports like Fed easing, though watch for volatility from potential real rate hikes or dollar strength.
After gold's stellar +65% advance to over₹140,000 per 10g (peaking at $4,550 spot), targets point to $4,400–$5,000 (₹146,700–₹155,000), with key supports at₹120,900 and₹106,000, and resistances at₹146,700–₹155,000. Silver, following its breach of $83 spot (₹254,000/kg) and +120% yearly surge, eyes cluster around $50--$70 per ounce and 230,000—180,000 with potential to outpace gold, backed by supports at₹211,600–₹180,000 and resistances at₹260,000–₹295,000.
For Thursday, 1 January, according to brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, MCX gold has support at₹1,34,900, followed by₹1,34,300, while resistance is at₹1,36,100 and₹1,36,600.
MCX silver has support at₹2,35,000 and₹2,33,100, while resistance is at₹2,38,500 and₹2,41,500, Motilal Oswal said.
Sugandha Sachdeva, Founder of SS WealthStreet, expects gold to find strong near-term support around₹1.29 lakh per 10 grams, with major medium-term support placed near₹1.21 lakh per 10 grams.
Looking ahead into 2026, gold prices are seen heading towards the₹1.85 lakh–₹2 lakh per 10 grams zone, supported by a confluence of powerful macro tailwinds, said Sachdeva.
MCX gold rates slipped in the morning trade on Thursday, 1 January, on profit booking amid a rise in the US dollar. However, increased expectations of further rate cuts by the US Fed this year limited the losses for the yellow metal. MCX gold February futures were 0.13% down at₹1,35,267 per 10 grams around 10 am. MCX silver March contracts were 0.06% up at₹2,35,842 per kg at that time.
Gold enters 2026 against a backdrop of continuing geo political uncertainty, sticky inflation in US, rate cut cycle and weak dollar echoing the dynamics of 2025. While recent price movements have elevated the risk, several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors continue to point towards a supportive environment for gold rather than headwinds. Central bank buying, uncertainty over trade disputes, and unresolved geopolitical tensions are expected to reinforce gold’s role as a safe-haven asset and support gold prices. Investment demand, which was a key driver of gains in 2025, retains significant potential. Even in a bearish scenario, investors are likely to maintain exposure to gold as a hedge against unpredictable global dynamics and elevated equity valuations, said Mirae Asset MF
Gold prices are expected to consolidate in the range of $4320 (~₹134,000) and $4420 (~₹137,000) after this sharp rally and sell off this week, predicts Renisha Chainani, Head - Research at Augmont.
According to the CBDT Instruction No. 1916, dated 11th May 1994, ""In the case of a person not assessed to wealth tax, gold jewellery and ornaments to the extent of 500 gm per married lady, 250 gm per unmarried lady, and 100 gm per male member of the family need not be seized.""It was also clarified that no seizure should be made by the Search Party of the Jewellery and Ornaments found during the course of search proceedings under section 132, where the same have been duly declared in the wealth tax returns filed by the taxpayer or where such ornaments are within the prescribed limits of 100 gm, 250 gm or 500 gm as stated in the said instruction.
Samir Arora's in a post on the social media platform X that stated that gold has beaten Indian equities and even the broader market over the long run, citing currency depreciation and questioning whether gold SIPs now make more sense. The post highlighted that the Nifty 50 in US dollar terms rose from about 1,000 in 1994 to 10,500, implying a CAGR of 7.8%, while gold prices surged from $345 to $4,550 over the same period, delivering a higher CAGR of 8.6%.
On January 1, 2026 (New Year's Day), US gold futures markets will be closed for regular trading hours, while spot gold trading will be very light as most global markets are shut. Some commodity exchanges, like the MCX in India, will have partial operations in the morning.
Gold and silver prices traded lower during the final session of 2025, yet both precious metals are on track for their biggest annual surge in over four decades.
Gold February futures slipped₹1,825 per 10 grams to the day’s low of₹1,34,841, though the month-to-date return still stood at 7%. Earlier this week, gold prices also crossed₹1.4 lakh per 10 grams to reach a new peak of₹1,40,465 on MCX.
Gold’s performance in 2025 reflects a structural shift in how investors and central banks are positioning portfolios. The rally is not driven by short-term speculation but by sustained investment flows into ETFs, alongside continued central bank buying as part of long-term reserve diversification. Elevated geopolitical risks, stretched equity valuations, rising sovereign debt and currency volatility have reinforced gold’s role as a strategic hedge rather than a tactical trade.
Even as inflation moderates, real yields are expected to remain constrained, which is historically supportive for gold. While some consolidation is natural after a sharp run-up, the medium-term outlook remains positive, with gold continuing to play a critical stabilising role in diversified portfolios heading into 2026, said Inderbir Singh Jolly, CEO, PL Wealth.
Gold prices have surged roughly 80% this year — its steepest annual rise since 1979 — fueled by US interest rate cuts, expectations of further monetary easing, geopolitical tensions, heavy central bank purchases, and robust ETF inflows. Prices eased from recent peaks as traders booked profits following a margin hike on precious metal futures by the CME.
Looking ahead to 2026, the key question is whether central banks’ sustained gold purchases can uphold valuations if a technical reset emerges. Nevertheless, the underlying drivers — inflation, currency weakness, and geopolitical uncertainty—remain strong enough to overcome any correction, keeping gold prices anchored in the USD 4,500–5,000 range, said Rajeev Sharan, Head – Criteria, Model Development & Research, Brickwork Ratings.",-1

According to the petitioners, the breach impacted at least 100 individuals across several US states, who said they lost personal information held by TriZetto. At least one complainant alleged that the Nasdaq-listed company was aware of the breach but still did not inform affected parties, a claim that could raise concerns for investors.
“In or about November 2024, hackers gained access to Defendants’ (Cognizant) computer network and accessed protected Private Information. Defendants claim to have first discovered the unauthorized access of its system on October 2, 2025, nearly a year after hackers had gained access,” according to one class action complaint filed by Liam Lytle, Maricruz Jimenez, and Carson Noel on 23 December.
The complainants said the total number of individuals affected by the breach remains unconfirmed and alleged that TriZetto failed to act promptly despite being aware of the incident.
The 23 December complaint alleged that Cognizant did not disclose critical details of the cyberattack.
“Defendants (Cognizant) have not disclosed the details of the cyberattack to Plaintiffs (complainants) or Class members, including the root cause of the data breach, the vulnerabilities exploited, and the remedial measures undertaken to ensure such a breach does not occur again. To date, these critical facts have not been explained or clarified to Plaintiffs and Class members, who retain a vested interest in ensuring that their Private Information remains protected,” read the class action complaint.
According to the petitioners, the alleged “unreasonable delay” in disclosure aggravated the financial harm suffered by affected individuals, as it prevented them from taking timely steps to protect themselves from identity theft and related risks. The delay, they said, led to incrementally higher damages than would have occurred with earlier notification.
The complainants raised concerns including the risk of losing healthcare coverage due to identity theft, potential increases in insurance premiums, and difficulties in resolving identity fraud.
Another complainant, Lisa Scorpio, alleged that her personal data may have been sold on illegal websites, raising the possibility of ransomware-linked activity.
“Plaintiff further believes her Private Information, and that of Class Members, was subsequently sold on the dark web following the Data Breach, as that is the modus operandi of cybercriminals that commit cyber-attacks of this type,” read the complaint filed by Scorpio in a New Jersey District Court on 29 December.
Mintcould not independently assess the financial impact of the alleged breach, though the complainants have claimed damages exceeding $5 million, excluding interest and legal costs.Minthas seen a copy of both the complaints.
The lawsuits allege that Cognizant is liable on at least 18 counts, including claims that it unfairly retained profits while failing to adequately secure patients’ personal data, despite being paid to protect such information as part of healthcare services.
Each of the four petitioners has sought a jury trial, monetary damages for losses and attorney fees, and court orders directing Cognizant to conduct regular third-party audits of its systems. They have also sought orders requiring the company to delete the affected individuals’ data unless it can demonstrate a legitimate need to retain it.
The affected parties are represented by New Jersey-based Seeger Weiss LLP, California-based Cotchet Pitre & McCarthy LLP, and Tennessee-based Milberg PLLC. Cognizant’s legal counsel is not known.
“TPS (TriZetto Provider Solutions) takes the protection of information very seriously and regrets any inconvenience this incident may have caused. Because this matter involves ongoing litigation, we are unable to provide further comment at this time,” said a Cognizant spokesperson.
Cognizant acquired TriZetto for $2.7 billion in September 2014 to process and manage healthcare claims, marking one of the largest acquisitions by an Indian IT services firm.
Cyber breaches have affected several Indian IT firms in recent years. Apart from Infosys’ McCamish settlement, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd has faced at least three cyber incidents at marquee clients, including Jaguar Land Rover and retailers Marks & Spencer and Co-op.
The lawsuits against Cognizant come about three years after S Ravi Kumar took over as chief executive of the company.
“This is likely to drag on for a year or more and then be settled. All tech services firms face this risk however, Cognizant has greater exposure to cyber risks as they combine a software offering with outsourcing which increases their exposure relative to other tech services firms which just provide just the managed service. All that said, cyber risks are increasing and expensive to mitigate. It is also impossible to completely protect against,” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of Everest Group, a Texas-based IT research firm.
Bendor-Samuel added that the costs of the case are likely to be covered by insurance and could run into tens of millions of dollars.
TriZetto’s acquisition helped accelerate growth in Cognizant’s healthcare business. The company, which follows a January-December fiscal year, reported revenue of $19.74 billion in 2024, with health sciences clients accounting for nearly a third of total revenue, making it the company’s largest business segment. In 2013, prior to the TriZetto acquisition, health sciences contributed slightly more than a quarter of Cognizant’s annual revenue.",1

Weschler, 64, is a value-oriented investor who joined Berkshire as an investment manager in 2012 and has run an estimated 5% of Berkshire’s $300 billion equity portfolio since then. He had jointly run a $2 billion investment fund, Peninsula Capital, before joining Berkshire.
He personally owns more than $200 million of stock in kidney dialysis provider DaVita and a $15 million interest in Sirius XM Holdings, the satellite radio company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that detail the holdings of Berkshire and Weschler in those two stocks.
Berkshire hasn’t confirmed what Weschler’s precise role will be in 2026 as Berkshire executive Greg Abel takes over as CEO. But Berkshire said when it hired Weschler as an investment manager that after Buffett “no longer serves as CEO, Todd and Ted – possibly aided by one additional manager – will have responsibility for the entire equity and debt portfolio of Berkshire, subject to overall direction by the then-CEO and Board of Directors.”
Todd Combs has resigned from Berkshire to take an investment role at JPMorgan Chase, the two companies said earlier in December.
That leaves Weschler with a potentially major role in managing the Berkshire equity portfolio, which is dominated by a handful of stocks: Apple, American Express, Bank of America, Chevron, and Coca-Cola. Berkshire also has many smaller holdings that likely were accumulated by Weschler and Combs, who each ran about 5% of the portfolio.
Weschler didn’t respond to a request for comment. He has said little publicly about his investments since coming to Berkshire, and he hasn’t been on stage at any of Berkshire’s annual meetings.
Buffett hasn’t disclosed his investment performance, though he did tell CNBC in 2019 that Weschler and Combs each were slightly behind the S&P 500 since joining Berkshire.
Both managers likely have lagged behind the market since then. Berkshire owns over $4 billion of DaVita, likely Weschler’s largest investment, and $3 billion of Sirius XM, another big holding seen as linked to him.
DaVita stock is flat over the past five years. Sirius XM is down over 60%, hurt by investor concerns about subscriber losses at Sirius’s core satellite radio business and an aging audience. At around $20, it trades for half its price 10 years ago.
Weschler was first exposed to Buffett’s writings in 1979 as an undergraduate at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, when a friend told him to “read anything he writes,” according to a 2022 Weschler interview available on YouTube.
“There was tremendous clarity to what he wrote,” Weschler said. “He has been a hero of mine” since then.
Weschler got to spend time with Buffett, and eventually a job at Berkshire, by purchasing lunches with the CEO auctioned by the San Francisco charity Glide. He paid $2,626,311 at the 2010 auction and then a dollar more in 2011,
After a meal at Piccolo’s, a now defunct Omaha steakhouse, in 2011, an impressed Buffett told Weschler he would be a “good fit” for Berkshire, according to the YouTube interview. Buffett followed up with an offer for a role as an investment manager.
Weschler lives and works in Charlottesville, Va., and spends two to three days a week in Omaha.
Weschler drew attention in 2021 when Allan Sloan, a contributor to Barron’s, wrote for the Washington Post about how Weschler had turned a $70,000 IRA account into $221 million by 2018 through a series of successful investments.
It remains to be seen what roles Weschler, Buffett and Abel will play with the equity portfolio and in capital allocation. The latter is critical because Berkshire is sitting on more than $350 billion of cash.
Buffett has sold almost 75% of Berkshire’s holding in Apple in recent years. But that investment still totals about $65 billion, the largest equity stake held by the company.
It is possible that Berkshire will make minimal changes to the portfolio. That would mirror the current situation at Daily Journal, a small publishing and software company that had been chaired by Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s longtime vice chairman, until not long before Munger’s death at 99 in 2023.
Munger ran the Daily Journal investment portfolio of about $500 million that includes stocks like Wells Fargo, and the company decided to essentially leave the portfolio alone after his death.
Berkshire may say more about the management of the portfolio in the coming weeks. Abel is likely to address it in his first shareholder letter, due around March 1.",4

Overall, sovereign owned investors ploughed $66 billion into investments in artificial intelligence and digitalization in 2025, the data firm said. Middle East sovereign wealth funds led on digital investments, with Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co. investing $12.9 billion in AI and digitalization, followed by the Kuwait Investment Authority’s $6 billion and Qatar Investment Authority’s $4 billion in 2025.
The Middle East continues to be a hotspot for sovereign wealth fund riches. The main seven Gulf wealth funds accounted for 43% of all capital invested by state owned investors globally at $126 billion, a historical maximum.
In particular, Saudi Arabi’s Public Investment Fund was the single largest dealmaker of 2025 by commiting $36.2 billion. Still, the PIF’s participation in the acquisition of Electronic Arts Inc. made up the bulk of that figure.
Stripping out that deal, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala was the most active sovereign wealth fund, investing a record $32.7 billion over 40 transactions, according to the report.
Sovereign investors — a term that encompasses other entities such as public pension funds — grew their might in 2025 amid a market of strong returns for investors across fixed income, public equities, real estate and infrastructure, according to Global SWF.
The US stands out with $13.2 trillion in assets under management by state owned investors, followed by China with $8.2 trillion and the United Arab Emirates at $2.9 trillion.
Overall, the number one destination for state owned investments, by some margin, was the US, attracting some $131.8 billion in 2025 compared with $68.9 billion a year earlier, the report said. Investments into China by sovereign owned investors fell to $4.3 billion from $10.3 billion in 2024.",3

India’s largest information technology (IT) services company will consider allowing data architects and data scientists to log in for a few hours with the option to work elsewhere, according to a senior executive at the company, who didn’t want to be identified as the information is not yet public.
“For instance, data architects do not need to work for 8 hours; their work often gets done in four hours, and then why should they not be allowed to work somewhere else? We will look at these sorts of gig options for skilled employees, and that will be the future of the workplace,” the executive said.
India’s software services providers mostly hire full-time employees. TCS’s plan marks a shift for the IT sector, as companies struggle to retain AI-related specialists. And it comes when the company faces margin pressure, and the offshoring giant has lined up massive investments in data centres.
TCS ended fiscal 2024-25 with $30.18 billion in revenue, up 3.8% on a yearly basis, and stares at a revenue decline in the ongoing financial year 2025-26. It lost key clients to competitors, and the completion of the 4G network deployment contract with state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd has slowed down revenue collection.
Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a Massachusetts-based IT consulting firm, however, said that TCS’s plan “is not a wholesale change to employment models”.
To be sure, India’s IT firms, including TCS, had called the practice of moonlighting by employees during the pandemic-era recruitment frenzy an “ethical” issue. Flexible hiring, however, will be driven by the need for efficiency, experts said.
“Larger IT firms have plenty of legacy workforce, and they are re-imagining better talent utilisation with this move,” said Kshitij Saraf, equities associate at Tusk Investments. “If they are getting a better return on investment, they will do it.

Both Saraf and Fersht said the model will be useful for architects, domain experts, certain AI specialists or advisory roles, and far less applicable to delivery-heavy, junior or team-dependent positions.
“Mid-tier IT services companies and engineering research firms, which would probably work more closely with clients and focus on product designing, like that of a pilot cockpit, for instance, might not do something like this because such a move exposes their inner workings to competitors,” he said.",1

From JSW Paints acquiring AkzoNobel to Torrent Group acquiring J.B. Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals to Bajaj Finance buying out Allianz, growth-hungry Indian business groups are now making substantive M&A moves, he said.
“We have seen thatcapital fromglobal investors is headed towards India,and domestic capital continues to flowunabated. Domestic groups are getting stronger and stronger and becoming very active in M&A. They will continuegrowing viaM&A, and I think M&A activity and volumes in calendar 2026 will surpass that in 2025,”Malliksaid.
For 2025, Kotak Mahindra Group’s investment banking arm led domestic banks in investment banking fees and ranked fourth overall, generating $77.4 million in revenues across equity, debt, and M&A deals.
“The deal activity is reasonably broad and wide. There are obviously the larger groups who are more active when it comes to M&A, but mid-sized businesses, too, have been throwing up deal opportunities, both as acquirers or targets. It is driven by business confidence, comfort around balance sheets, and availability of capital, both debt as well as equity,” Mallik said.
M&As in India are driven by groups looking to enter new segments, hive off non-core businesses, or deepen penetration and market share in their existing businesses. In some cases, first-generation entrepreneurs are looking to exit the business for the lack of succession.
Private equity (PE) investors have also become a force to reckon with. Driving not just private capital deals, these are the firms that are readying their portfolio firms for public market debuts. Sponsors, as the investment banking industry calls them, have become a big source of deal volume. From acquiring listed companies to listing their privately held firms, PE groups are very active in the deal-making space.
“We've seen that sponsors now have increased comfort around listed companies, and are becoming sole promoters of listed companies and are proactively taking control of the listed companies.”
Global companies, too, are increasingly stepping up their pace of deal making in India. This year, on one hand, we saw global players coming in droves, on the other, firms taking some money off the table by selling partially or fully to leverage high valuations and deep liquidity pool in India.
“There are many global companies, due to their own global needs and requirements, who are rebalancing their portfolios and are optimizing the capital structure of their Indian businesses. We will expect to see that also continue to happen in the coming years, and also contribute to M&A and ECM (Equity Capital Markets) activity,” Mallik added.
However, what stands out is the heightened interest from Japanese multinationals in the country. This year alone, we saw three mega deals where groups such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.,Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. together pump in more than $7.2 billion in the country buying into Shriram Finance, Yes Bank and Avendus Group, respectively.
“They are here to stay and are long-term investors. They've been looking at Indiafora really, really long period of time. The covid-19 pandemic put atemporary pausein many of their thinking and planning. But we are seeing them make some big bets,” Mallik said, adding: “I think it's clear that the mandate for Japanese companies from their investors and their boards is to go global and have a global footprint. It's taken them some time, and they've arrived in full force.”",-1

The order issued Wednesday sets the stage for a Colorado-led group of state attorneys general to investigate what led federal antitrust enforcers to reach a settlement with the companies that allows the merger to proceed.
US District Judge Casey Pitts in San Jose, California, ruled last month that the states can seek more information about the controversial settlement — which led to the firing of two DOJ officials who objected to the tactics HPE used to close the acquisition. But the two sides differ on the scope of the Tunney Act, a 1974 law requiring court approval of DOJ antitrust settlements.
In Wednesday’s order, Pitts wrote that the the states are entitled to at least some of the pretrial information sharing that occurred after the Justice Department sued HPE in January to block its purchase of Juniper — the first antitrust case brought by the new Trump administration.
“That record is undoubtedly relevant because it will help the states evaluate the risks to competition posed by the proposed merger, the degree to which the proposed judgment addresses those risks and the strength of the United States’s underlying case,” he wrote.
Pitts directed both sides to submit more briefing and said that if he concludes an evidence hearing is necessary to determine whether the settlement passes muster under the Tunney Act, it will be held March 23-27. The states have been far apart from the DOJ and the companies on what that hearing would entail.
The states were asking for a mini-trial of sorts with months of fact-finding that they say is needed to expose an allegedly corrupt process that led to the settlement. The government and companies meanwhile say Pitts should only examine the merits of the settlement and whether it is in the public interest.
Pitts had earlier indicated that much of the process behind the settlement is likely shielded by attorney-client privilege and the government’s ability to make confidential decisions.
The settlement the DOJ reached days before trial allowing the deal to close requires only a minor divestiture of one of HPE’s business, known as Instant On, and a commitment to license certain Juniper technology.
Whatever attention Pitts gives to the government’s internal deliberations, he seemed somewhat skeptical of the merits of the settlement during a November hearing. He questioned why it requires HPE to sell its Instant On networking business, which wasn’t the subject of the original lawsuit.
“I don’t recall reading about Instant On,” Pitts said at the time, noting that he was “very in the weeds” on the case when it settled since he was preparing for trial. “In that respect, it was interesting to see the settlement.”",-1

The head-on collision on Tuesday killed one person, a train driver, and injured dozens more. The iconic tourist destination in Peru’s Andes mountains draws more than 1 million visitors every year. Many make the short journey from Cusco city or nearby towns in the region’s “Sacred Valley” by rail since the remote UNESCO heritage site can’t directly be accessed by road.
Paris-headquartered LVMH owns a stake in one of the train operators, PeruRail SA, through its investment in Belmond Ltd., a high-end hospitality and travel business that LVMH acquired in 2019. Belmond’s website advertises the trip to its affluent clientele in “finest luxury” wagons where they can “feast upon exquisite Peruvian cuisine, then venture to our vintage cocktail bar.”
Belmond also owns 50% of the company, Ferrocarril Transandino SA, that has the concession to operate the railway line along which the crash happened, according to a 2025 Ferrocarril Transandino business plan.
Representatives for LVMH and Belmond didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The PeruRail train rammed into one operated by Inca Rail SA, where a Carlyle unit owns a majority stake. Carlyle has been trying to sell the stake via an asset manager that administers its Peru holdings.
Carlyle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The asset manager, GRAM, declined to comment.
Carlyle entered the Peruvian rail tourism market about a decade ago, backing Inca Rail’s upgrades on the route between Sacred Valley towns and the foot of Machu Picchu, which winds along the Urubamba River and has narrow rights-of-way. The deal seemed to exemplify how global capital has become entwined with tourist outposts and their infrastructure connections.
PeruRail said in a Wednesday statement on its website that it evacuated 2,000 passengers in the early hours of the morning to a nearby town and had started to get its train service back up and running.
Inca Rail said in a Tuesday regulatory filing that it immediately implemented safety and emergency procedures after the collision and was coordinating with authorities to investigate the causes.
The incident at Peru’s top attraction comes at a time when the country’s tourism industry has been struggling to rebuild after the Covid-19 pandemic.",3

“I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the Chief Executive Officer of the company at year end,” Buffett told shareholders and investors in the May meeting.
Greg Abel has been heading the BNSF, Berkshire's railroad company, food brands Dairy Queen and See's Candies, and other manufacturing and retail businesses, since 2018.
Over the years, Abel, even though out of the spotlight, has been interacting with the media during appearances at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meetings and interviews alongside Warren Buffett.
“I think hard work leads to good outcomes. In my schooling, in sports, and in my business positions, I learned that if I put in a lot of work and was well-prepared, then success would be more likely,” said Greg Abel, back in an interview in 2018.
Effective 1 Janaury 2026, Greg Abel will take over Berkshire Hathaway's various businesses as the new CEO of the conglomerate, which employs more than 400,000 employees and has a presence in multiple ventures.
Investors are now focusing on Abel to make an impact on Berkshire Hathaway's trajectory. However, the agency report fromAPhighlights that the investors are not expecting any seismic shifts.

According to officials familiar with the matter, the cabinet has decided to freeze the struggling telco’s pending adjusted gross revenues (AGR) dues at₹87,695 crore for five years. The amount can be paid from fiscal year 2032 (FY32) through FY41.
That means the AGR amount will not increase, but it does not also reduce the overall AGR dues of the company, even though the officials said that the recalculation is still on the table and the amount may reduce later. A Supreme Court ruling in October had allowed the government to reassess and recalculate the AGR dues up to FY17.
However, the company will still have to pay AGR dues pertaining to FY18 and FY19—which is over and above the₹87,695 crore in question—from FY26 through FY31, the official added.
AGR is the revenue base used to calculate licence fees and spectrum usage charges payable to the government.
News of the cabinet’s move shook investor confidence, sending Vi’s stock plunging 11.5% on the National Stock Exchange to₹10.67 on Wednesday, with no clarity forthcoming on either the overall AGR dues or any relief on interest and penalties pertaining to the dues.
Queries emailed to DoT and Vodafone Idea did not elicit any response till the press time.
The cabinet’s decision also leaves the company in a lurch as far as raising funds is concerned. The telco had previously warned that it won’t survive FY27 without raising funds, and banks are hesitant to lend without a generous bailout or clarity on the AGR dues.
To be sure, if the moratorium on AGR dues had not come in, the company would have had to pay an instalment of approximately₹18,000 crore due on 31 March 2026.
It will, however, have to pay deferred spectrum liability dues in FY27, which was estimated at₹5,000 crore in a note dated 24 December by brokerage house Ambit Capital. The brokerage expects the company's cash ebitda at₹12,100 crore in FY27.
The government owns nearly 49% stake in Vodafone Idea after converting nearly₹53,083 crore of dues into equity in two tranches in February 2023 and April 2025. Of the roughly₹2 trillion in total government dues, about₹1.17 trillion relates to spectrum payments rather than AGR.
In a separate exchange filing on Wednesday, Vodafone Idea said that its promoter group entity Vodafone International Holdings B.V. has entered into an implementation agreement with certain promoter group shareholders to release the pending₹5,836 crore payment to the company.
As part of the agreement, the company will receive₹2,307 crore in cash from Vodafone International Holdings over the next 12 months. The remaining₹3,529 crore is secured through the earmarking of 3.28 billion equity shares of the company by certain Vodafone Group shareholders for a period of five years.
Proceeds from the sale of these shares, at the instructions of a person authorised/ appointed by the company, will accrue to the company, it said.
The company had also mentioned during its earnings call that it continues to remain in talks with the banks to raise₹25,000 crore. However, banks had also sought clarity on the AGR dues before lending to the company, Vodafone Idea had said.

In FY25, the company reported revenue of around₹650 crore, of which nearly a third, about₹200 crore, came from viability gap funding (VGF), said Shrenik Ghodawat, executive director of the group. The company is privately held and is yet to file its FY25 numbers with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).
The subsidy is typically available for three years from the start of a route, after which airlines must operate commercially. Fares on UDAN seats are capped based on route distance, limiting revenue upside. “Hence, GEPL is protected to a certain extent against soaring fuel costs; however, this benefit applies only to UDAN seats and lasts for three years from the commencement of the route,” rating agency India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said in an April note.
“₹1,100 crore we will do this year (topline for FY26). Last year (fiscal), we did₹650 crore,” Ghodawat said. “Our growth is coming from disciplined expansion, not chasing capacity for the sake of scale. We are building routes where there is willingness to pay for time,” he toldMint.
Ghodawat said 70-75% of Star Air’s routes are “effectively monopolistic”, either due to UDAN exclusivity or because deploying larger aircraft on those sectors is uneconomical. Pricing power is limited, as fares on UDAN routes are capped on a portion of seats.
On the question of profitability once UDAN subsidies taper off, Ghodawat noted that VGF is typically available for three years per route. He said the airline has been Ebitda-positive for four consecutive years, from FY21 to FY24, and “turned net profitable last year, without relying on one-off gains.”
Founded in 2019, Star Air operates largely outside India’s busiest aviation corridors, focusing on direct connectivity between tier-3, tier-4 and tier-5 cities—an operating footprint that also qualifies it for scheme subsidies.
Unlike larger airlines that rely on a hub-and-spoke model centred on metro airports, Star Air runs point-to-point services such as Belgaum–Ahmedabad, Kolhapur–Ahmedabad, Hyderabad–Nanded and Bengaluru–Jharsuguda. These routes are primarily aimed at business travellers, who account for over 60% of the airline’s passenger base.
“There are people who are happy to pay for a 40-minute flight instead of a six-hour road journey or an overnight train,” Ghodawat said. “That day-return product is what we are optimising for.”
The strategy is supported by a tightly controlled fleet plan. While Star Air’s fleet is largely leased, it does not rely on sale-and-leaseback structures commonly used by India’s largest carriers. The airline purchased its first four aircraft outright, while the rest are taken on dry lease directly from lessors. As it scales toward a fleet of 40–50 aircraft over the next four to five years, it plans to use a mix of operating leases, finance leases and selective purchases, Ghodawat said.
To fund this expansion, the airline recently raised₹150 crore in fresh capital and plans to raise another₹200–250 crore next year, taking total equity mobilisation to about₹350 crore over two years. “The next round is about fleet growth,” Ghodawat said.
Around₹50 crore of the capital has been earmarked to set up a maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility in India, initially focused on Embraer aircraft. The remaining funds will be deployed towards aircraft deposits, digital systems, spares, tools and reliability upgrades. The planned MRO also reflects the airline’s efforts to manage rising dollar-denominated costs, as lease rentals and maintenance reserves are paid in dollars.
Mark D Marting, founder and chief executive at Martin Consulting, said, “Historically, subsidization of routes and ticket prices has not worked in India. Star Air has to ensure commercial viability beyond the three-year subsidy period and expand presence on routes that are profitable. Currently, the airline remains dependent on UDAN subsidies, but if aircraft induction plans materialise and new routes turn viable, operations could become more commercially lucrative. Sticking to an all-Embraer fleet for regional connectivity is a good move, giving them an advantage at several smaller airports.”
Competition remains limited on many of Star Air’s routes, as larger airlines generally avoid deploying jets on thin-demand sectors. However, other regional players such as Fly91 and the government-backed Alliance Air operate on some routes, along with major carriers like IndiGo and SpiceJet.
Star Air is part of Kolhapur-based Sanjay Ghodawat Group, which has interests spanning aviation, energy, real estate and education. Shrenik Ghodawat is the son of Sanjay Ghodawat, founder-chairman of the group.

The move comes on a day when gig workers across India, including delivery partners working with platforms such as Zomato and Swiggy, have gone on strike to protest against low pay, lack of social security and poor working conditions, even as platforms brace for higher order volumes on New Year’s Eve.
“This is part of our standard annual operating protocol during festive periods, which typically see higher earning opportunities due to increased demand,” a spokesperson for Eternal, Zomato's parent company, said in the statement.
According to a social media post on Zomato’s official delivery-partner page, more than 23,000 gig workers earned over₹1,500 on 25 December.
Zomato expects its delivery partners to earn up to₹3,000 on New Year's Eve individually over the day, another post on the page said.
The company is offering its delivery partners₹120-150 per order during peak hours between 6 PM and 12 AM, as per people familiar with the matter.
Additionally, Zomato has waived penalties on order cancellations and denials, a move aimed at reducing the risk of income loss during uneven order flow periods and high demand.
Responding to queries fromLivemint, Swiggy said the incentives were part of its standard operating practice.
“At Swiggy, we are committed to empowering our delivery partners. As part of our standard process, enhanced incentives are offered on special occasions such as festivals, allowing delivery partners to benefit from increased earning opportunities during peak demand periods across the year,” the company said in its statement.
The platform is advertising peak-hour earnings of up to₹2,000 for the six-hour window between 6 PM and 12 AM on New Year’s Eve, according to the PTI report, as it looks to ensure adequate rider availability during one of the busiest ordering periods of the year.
Telangana Gig and Platform Workers' Union (TGPWU) and Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT) have claimed that lakhs of workers are set to join the nationwide strike to demand better pay and improved working conditions.
The strike may affect the operations of food delivery and quick commerce firms like Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, Instamart and Zepto on New Year's Eve, when demand is at an all-time high, according to industry sources cited byPTI.

“We have a new method that should wipe out 99% fraud,” Bier added, addressing the second part of Musk's suggestion.
Musk's tweet elicited an enthusiastic response from independent journalist Nick Shirley, who had recently made headlines after exposing daycare centre fraud in Minnesota.
""Yes, this would be amazing, X so far hasn’t been able to compete with YouTube Adsense, but it is a much more effective platform for videos to be shared and seen by the masses without censorship,"" Shirley said.
“I’ve been telling my friends for months to be posting on X but they haven’t made the effort because their time is better used (monetarily) on other platforms,” he added.
Several other netizens also jumped in on the conversation, with many hailing it as a “real game changer”.
Users argued that platforms that pay creators well would be the only ones left with authoritative content, with large language models (LLMs) consuming most of the material on the internet.
Musk's comment sanctioning higher creator payouts comes at a time when digital platforms are competing to retain original, human-created and authoritative content amid an onslaught of AI-generated material.
It also comes months after the Tesla chief stated that X needed to step up its payouts to creators to compete with the likes of YouTube.
Commenting on a tweet by Bier, which criticised creator payouts as doing ""more harm than good"", Musk corrected his head of product, saying, “No, the issue is that we are underpaying and not allocating payment accurately enough.”
The X chief also directly compared the social media platform's model with that of Google-owned YouTube, flatly saying, “YouTube does a much better job.”
The creator monetisation programme on X was introduced after Musk's $44 billion takeover of the microblogging platform, and in its current state, the programme allows verified users to earn a share of ad revenue based on engagement metrics.
However, despite introducing a payout system for creators, Musk's platform was criticised by many for various issues, including inconsistent earnings, delayed payments, and unclear monetisation metrics.
The X chief's latest comment appears intended to address issues faced by creators, while also addressing concerns that higher payouts could lead to the abuse of engagement metrics, including artificial and bot-driven amplification of content.

The company is working closely with its IPO bankers to tap growth-stage investment firms, the people cited above said. “The talks are still in early stages and calls with several investors have been held,” one of them said.
A second person added that the round is expected to help establish the valuation benchmark that InMobi is targeting for its IPO.
“Its IPO bankers may only lead this process since it’s a fairly well-known company and does not need separate bankers for private funding,” a third person said, adding that the process of appointing bankers is also running in parallel.
The fundraise comes as InMobi navigates the process of shifting its domicile to India from Singapore. The company has raised more than $700 million across debt and equity over the years, with investors including Kleiner Perkins and Sherpalo Ventures.
All three people spoke on condition of anonymity. InMobi did not respond toMint’s requests for comment.
The development comes weeks after InMobi raised $350 million in new financing from Varde Partners, Elham Credit Partners and SeaTown Holdings, according to a report byThe Economic Times.
The report said most of the proceeds would be used to fund a share buyback from existing investors, primarily SoftBank and other private equity shareholders.
Following the transaction, SoftBank’s stake fell to about 5–7% from around 35%. The deal was finalised at a valuation of under $1 billion.
Founded in 2007 by Naveen Tewari, InMobi offers mobile display advertising, app-install campaigns and other adtech solutions, increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence to serve advertisers.
The company works with marketers and publishers, helping them connect with target audiences using data-driven analytics and providing tools for monetization, consent management and user engagement.
Glance, backed by Google and Jio Platforms, achieved unicorn status around five years ago and is also eyeing a separate public listing—although after InMobi’s IPO.
InMobi earns a fee when it arranges advertisements on Glance, similar to other third-party apps. Glance remains an unconsolidated subsidiary, meaning its balance sheet is separate from InMobi’s, though the parent benefits as the platform scales.
The core adtech business, where SoftBank is an investor, has been profitable since 2016, though margins have fluctuated, partly due to the pandemic.
In FY24, InMobi reported about $600 million in total revenue, with its core adtech business contributing over $300 million. Glance posted revenue of₹614 crore (around $73 million). Media reports had earlier said the company was targeting $700 million in revenue by FY25.
In FY23, InMobi reported revenue of $281 million, while profit declined to $41 million from $50 million in FY22,Minthad reported earlier.
India’s advertising economy is set for rapid expansion over the next five years, with digital firmly at the centre, according to consultancy firm Bain & Co. The firm estimates that India’s overall advertising market stood at $16–18 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow at 10–15% annually over the next 4 years.
Within this, digital already contributes 50–60% of total ad spends and is expected to grow faster, at ~15% CAGR, to $17–19 billion by 2029, the consultancy firm said in a report earlier this year, adding that India remains among the fastest-growing ad markets in Asia-Pacific and globally.

OpenAI has also received an upsized syndicated co-investment worth $11 billion from other backers, the investment holding company added in its statement.
The announcement comes hours afterCNBCfirst reported about the completion of the transaction.
AI has become the central axis of global technology markets this year, driving a surge of investment by the world's largest companies and reshaping investor expectations.
“We are deeply aligned with OpenAI’s vision of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity,” CEO Masayoshi Son said.
“SoftBank saw the potential of AI early and committed with a deep belief in its impact on humanity. Their global leadership and scale help us move faster and bring advanced intelligence to the world,” Altman said.
The deal valued OpenAI at around $300 billion on a post-money basis, but a later secondary stock sale completed in October, valued the company at around $500 billion, according to Pitchbook data cited byReuters.
The completion of the latest funding round for OpenAI comes just days after SoftBank unveiled a deal to buy digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge Group in a deal valued at $4 billion.
SoftBank and OpenAI, with Oracle, are also leading the $500-billion Stargate project to build AI infrastructure in the United States announced by President Donald Trump in January 2025.

The 2022 ordeal had forced him to sell his stake at Tinkoff Bank at an unbelievable discount, effectively costing him almost all his fortune as billions of his wealth got wiped out in a day.
According to Forbes, before starting Tinkoff Bank, he founded frozen food producer Daria, Tinkoff Beer and Tinkoff Restaurants.
He sold his alcohol business to InBev in 2005, and then started the bank next year, which has now become one of the world's biggest online banks.
Following his alleged fallout with the government, Tinkov sold his 35% stake at Tinkoff Bank for just 3% of the valuation, he toldBBC. Thereafter, he moved out of Russia and later gave up his citizenship for the country.
In April 2022, Oleg Tinkov publicly lashed out at Russia's war on Ukraine, condemning the conflict as “insane”.
According to a report by Hindustan Times, he also claimed that 90% Russians are opposed to war, and called the remaining 10% “morons”.

United Arab Emirates-based company filed the claim against Guinea for revoking its mining rights in May. Axis, which says it’s the country’s second-largest bauxite producer, submitted its arbitration claim to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, an arm of the World Bank.
“Guinea is ready to defend its interests,” Minister of Mines and Geology Bouna Sylla said by phone from the nation’s capital, Conakry. “We will go to arbitration, but Axis is not in the right.”
The arbitration comes as President Mamadi Doumbouya, the leader of Guinea’s military junta, seeks to attract more mining investors to the West African nation. The country is the top exporter of bauxite, a raw material that’s refined into alumina, the main feedstock for making aluminum, and earlier this year it started shipments from Simandou, one of the world’s largest iron-ore deposits.
The dispute also reflects a broader push by African governments to increase their share of resource revenues. Guinea’s government has terminated a number of older concessions because it says they failed to comply with its rules. That includes the Axis permit that covered a bauxite mine at Boffa, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest of Conakry.
“The permit was canceled based on violations of the mining code and the general tax code of the Republic of Guinea,” Sylla said. “The company wasn’t involved itself in mining operations but subcontracted the permit with two other companies from which it was receiving $2 on each ton, while making no investment and paying no taxes.”
Axis said the reason Guinea gave for canceling its permit was because the mine wasn’t operating, a claim that wasn’t true.
“The law is on our side,” Axis founder and Chairman Pankaj Oswal said in emailed response to questions. “International investment law exists precisely to protect mining investors facing these types of situations.”

Discovery is likely to reject Paramount Skydance's amended $108.4 billion hostile bid for the storied Hollywood studio, despite a personal guarantee from billionaire Larry Ellison backing the media giant's offer, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The board has yet to make a final decision, but is expected to meet next week, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
Ellison, whose son David is chairman and CEO of Paramount, personally guaranteed the equity underpinning the bid, hoping to ease doubts that had dogged its earlier proposal.
The company did not increase its $30-per-share all-cash offer, but it raised its regulatory reverse termination fee to match Netflix and extended its tender offer deadline.
Netflix's $82.7 billion offer, while lower in headline value, offers a clearer financing structure and fewer execution risks, analysts have said.
Under the terms of that agreement, Warner Bros. would face a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it walked away from the Netflix deal.
Harris Oakmark, Warner Bros' fifth-largest investor with 96 million shares, said the revised offer wasn't ""sufficient"" and noted that it was not enough to cover the breakup fee.
Warner Bros.' board previously urged shareholders to reject Paramount's $108.4 billion bid for the entire company, including its cable television assets, citing concerns over financing certainty and the absence of a full guarantee from the Ellison family.
Paramount argued its offer was more market-proof than Netflix's $82.7 billion proposal, whose value has fluctuated with Netflix's share price.
Lawmakers from both parties raised concerns about further consolidation in the media industry. US President Donald Trump had said he planned to weigh in on the landmark acquisition.

He was also alleged to have failed to declare valuables to authorities, including jewelry, paintings and wines.
Usmanov’s defense team had challenged the allegations about his ties to the companies and valuables and the applicability of EU law in the case.
The prosecutors said the discontinuation of the investigation upon the payment was authorized under German criminal law.

Discovery Inc. plans to once again reject a takeover bid from Paramount Skydance Corp. after the rival media company amended the terms of its offer, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking.
The Warner Bros. board hasn’t made a final determination, but will meet next week, said the people, who asked to not be identified discussing internal deliberations. Among the board’s concerns, Paramount has yet to increase its offer, which Warner Bros. earlier rejected as inferior to one from Netflix Inc.
Paramount, the owner of its namesake studio and MTV, has been waging a public campaign to gather support for its proposal to buy Warner Bros., which owns HBO and CNN. Paramount went public with a $30-a-share cash bid on Dec. 8, three days after Warner Bros. accepted the deal with Netflix, which is only buying Warner Bros.’ studio and streaming businesses. Paramount has since amended its offer twice, most recently by including an assurance from billionaire Larry Ellison that he would personally guarantee $40.4 billion in equity financing and other commitments.
Paramount is controlled by Larry Ellison and his son David, a movie producer now assembling a media empire. The Ellisons took control of Paramount in August and have since submitted multiple bids for Warner Bros., which would give their undersized company another of Hollywood’s original studios and more scale in streaming.
The Warner Bros. board remains unmoved and is waiting for Paramount to increase the financial terms of its offer, said the people. Several shareholders have said they expect Paramount to offer more money. The board is also concerned that the Paramount deal won’t allow the company to manage its debt without the Ellisons’ approval and that Paramount hasn’t guaranteed that it would cover the breakup free that Warner Bros. would have to pay Netflix.
Warner Bros. has argued in public filings that it believes the Netflix offer is superior to the Paramount for a number of reasons, including that Paramount will be heavily indebted and plans to cut more jobs. Netflix is the most valuable company in Hollywood with a market value of more than $400 billion.

The British energy supplier posted a net loss of £255 million ($344 million) for the 12 months through April, compared with a profit a year earlier. It said the UK’s warmest spring on record drove down heating demand.
Founded a decade ago, Octopus has expanded fast to become the country’s biggest power supplier. But it didn’t post a profit until 2023, and earnings this year have been wiped out by lower energy use and a string of one-time expenses, as well as heavy investment in heat-pump, car-charging and solar businesses.
Octopus agreed to acquire failed supplier Bulb in October 2022, gaining 1.5 million accounts. But it had to return billions of pounds to the government to cover costs incurred by the state when it temporarily took Bulb into public ownership the year before.
The repayments were a key reason why cash fell to about £1.5 billion last fiscal year from £4.2 billion a year earlier, Octopus said in a statement on Tuesday.
Multiple UK power and gas suppliers went bust during the energy crisis. As a result, industry regulator Ofgem tightened the rules governing companies’ cash reserves, saying firms must hold more to withstand large swings in wholesale prices.
Octopus said earlier this year that it had fallen short of the requirements but was working toward compliance. It said Tuesday it has yet to meet the targets.

Macquarie, which holds a majority stake in the consortium controlling Southern, previously said it would pump more money into the company, indicating £245 million would be the minimum. The fresh injection adds to the £655 million it stumped up earlier this year to shore up the firm’s balance sheet and protect its credit rating.
Macquarie also reconfirmed that it would “provide up to £300 million of additional equity commitments” during the first half of 2026, according to a statement from Southern Water.
Britain’s water industry has been in crisis, with a combination of structural and financial problems resulting in chronic leaks and sewage spills, rising bills and a widespread loss of public trust. That’s driven up the risks of investing in the sector, which desperately needs funds to upgrade crumbling infrastructure.
The latest equity commitment is the final piece of a deal between Macquarie, Southern and its creditors that’s been in the making for almost a year. The utility had to bolster its capital to avoid another downgrade to junk, which would have put it in breach of the conditions attached to its operating license.
During the summer, creditors Ares Management Corp. and Westbourne Capital agreed to write off a substantial portion of Southern’s debt at the holding-company level in exchange for a minority stake. Holders of the debt sitting at the so-called midco level — which lies in between the operating and the holding companies — consented to extend maturities to at least September 2030.
Following the deal, which was implemented during the past few months, Southern has succeeded in tapping capital markets, selling £675 million of new bonds in November.

The tech giant is rapidly expanding its platforms to incorporate advanced AI.
Although the financial terms of the transaction were not publicly disclosed, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters that the deal could value the Singapore-based firm at $2-3 billion.
This acquisition comes as several tech giants are racing to develop and deploy advanced AI technologies, aiming to gain an edge in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence landscape.
These capabilities led commentators and tech enthusiasts to call it China's next DeepSeek, and it even received praise from Chinese state television,Reutersreported.
Manus, whose services are not available in China, claims its AI agent outperforms OpenAI's DeepResearch. Meta plans to operate and sell the Manus service, integrating it into its consumer and business products, including Meta AI, the company said.
Meta told the news outlet that it will keep Manus operating independently, while the startup’s AI agents will be integrated into Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, alongside Meta’s existing chatbot, Meta AI, which is already available to users.
Manus also recently announced that it has millions of users and earns an annual recurring revenue of more than $100 million from monthly and yearly subscribers.
For Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, this matters because it is an AI product that generates revenue, which is crucial at a time when investors are concerned about Meta's $60 billion investment in data centres and the broader tech industry's costly AI development, according toTechCrunch.

The airline will also operate flights to destinations across Uttar Pradesh in its first phase, he said, adding that two more aircraft are expected to join the fleet within the next one and a half months.
“At present, the fleet size is limited, but as it grows, we will cover the entire country,” he toldPTI, noting that plans of international operations are expected to materialise in 2028 or 2029.
To support this accessibility, Vishwakarma said that ticket prices would not be increased during peak festival seasons, though it intends to price its business-class tickets higher than those of its competitors.
“An aircraft is just a means of transport, like a bus or a tempo. It should not be seen as something exclusive,” he said.
Referring to the aviation sector as one of the fastest-growing areas, Vishwakarma said its biggest strength lies in strong cash flow. “There is no credit system in aviation. Many businesses collapse because they depend on credit, but aviation does not work that way,” he said.
Explaining the airline's name, he said, “Our trading firm was already called Shankh, and the name also has a cultural association. That is why we kept the airline's name Shankh as well.”
Speaking on funding for the company, Vishwakarma noted that the airline is fully backed by its parent company.
“The aircraft have been acquired on lease and finance from external companies. We have no funding constraints,” he said, adding the airline was not focused on competitors' market shares. “We are not concerned about who controls what. Our focus is on improving ourselves.”
He encouraged young people to ignore societal scepticism and focus on their personal growth. “The first thing they should stop worrying about is what people will say. If someone who once drove a tempo can run an airline, others can also move ahead. The difference is only in mindset.”

Besides the four office Reits, Nexus Select Trust is the fifth and only retail-focused Reit in the country.
Reits pool income-generating real estate assets, such as office parks and shopping malls, to help investors earn a share of the income produced without purchasing the properties. The Sebi regulations require at least 80% of a Reit’s assets to be completed and income-producing.
India's Reit market has achieved remarkable expansion over six years, with market capitalization growing from $3.1 billion in 2019-2020 to $19 billion as of 30 September 2025.
The sector has evolved from a single Reit in 2019 to five listed Reits collectively controlling 174 million sq ft of leasable office and retail space, highlighting its robust growth trajectory, property advisory JLL India said in a recent report.

One of the sources toldReutersthat Washington has introduced the annual approval system for exports of chipmaking tools to China.
Samsung, SK Hynix and TSMC had benefited from special exemptions to Washington's sweeping restrictions on exporting chip-related technology to China. These exemptions allowed them to receive American chipmaking equipment at their factories in China without seeking separate approvals each time.
With the objective of limiting China's access to advanced American technology, the US President Donald Trump's administration has been re-examining export controls that it believed were too relaxed under the Biden administration, Reuters reported.
South Korea's Samsung Electronics, the world's leading memory chipmaker, and SK Hynix, the second-largest, rely heavily on China as one of their key production bases, especially for traditional memory chips.
These chips have seen sharp price increases in recent months, largely driven by demand from AI data centres and tightened global supplies, the news report added.
However, the decision was met with sharp criticism from China hardliners and Democratic lawmakers, who cited concerns that Beijing could harness the technology to supercharge its military and ultimately bankrupt and replace Nvidia,Reutersreported earlier.

This is part of a broader agreement under which WestBridge is slated to acquire up to 15% stake in Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd for₹450 crore.
The transaction involved the transfer of shares in Edelweiss Asset Management to WestBridge affiliates, including Setu AIF Trust, Konark Trust, and MMPL Trust, according to a regulatory filing.
Edelweiss Financial transferred 10% of shares of Edelweiss Asset Management and Edelweiss Trusteeship Co. to the Westbridge affiliates on 17 December, and the balance stake of up to 5% will be transferred to the buyers as per the executed agreements, the Rashesh Shah-led firm said in the filing.
India's competition watchdog had approved the deal on 21 October, while the market regulator gave its nod on 12 November. The full transaction is expected to be completed by March 2026, Edelweiss said.
The deal, first announced in August, valued the asset management firm at around₹3,000 crore. It valued the business at 57 times the price-to-earnings on fiscal year 2025's bottom line of₹53 crore, which, Edelweiss said, aligned with industry benchmarks of 30-60 times.
For the six months ended September 2025, the mutual fund business contributed₹45 crore or 23% to Edelweiss Financial's consolidated profit after tax, marking a nearly 10% jump from the previous year's absolute contribution of₹41 crore.

The passenger load is a metric which is used in the aviation industry around the world to measure the total number of people carried in an aircraft. The numbers are also measured via passenger load factor (PLF), which shows the percentage of available seats that a filled by passengers.
Air India's passenger load factor also witnessed a massive 10.2% hike to 87.5% in November, compared to their earlier 77.3% levels in October 2025, fueled by the rising demand for air travel in India.
Like Air India and IndiGo, SpiceJet also witnessed a 5.5% rise in its passenger load to 87.7% in November, compared to its earlier 82.2% levels in October 2025, over rising bookings.
The airline was founded in December 2021 by Vinay Dube and Aditya Ghosh, and was backed by late marquee investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala.
Despite the drop in market share, Akasa Air's passenger load witnessed a 2.6% rise to 93.8% in November 2025, compared to 91.2% October 2025 levels.
Indian credit rating agency, ICRA, in its latest December aviation industry update report, mentioned that the Indian aviation industry is expected to report a net loss of₹17,000 to 18,000 crore (₹170-180 billion) in the financial year ending 2025-26.
“ICRA expects the Indian aviation industry to report a net loss of₹170-180 billion in FY2026, higher than its earlier forecast of₹95-105 billion,” said the ratings agency.

“All the climate tech bets we’re backing, we have a 10-15 year lens on them. That’s why we’re not worried about the short term,” Dinesh Pai, who leads Rainmatter's venture investments, said in an interview.
Since it began investing in 2016, Rainmatter has made 43 climate-tech investments, investing a total of₹350 crore. Rainmatter Foundation, which was set up in 2020 works as a different, non-profit entity which provides climate-related grants.
While the firm's initial focus was on fintech, in the early 2020s, it ramped up investments to include industries like health and wellness as well as climate.
Rainmatter’s stance comes at a time when many Indian venture capital funds have grown cautious on climate-tech, a sector that, despite early optimism, has struggled to deliver healthy exits or meaningful scale.
Average cheque sizes in the segment have declined over the past three years, dropping from $52 million in 2023 to $28 million in 2024 and $27 million in 2025, according to data from Venture Intelligence, a private company tracking platform.
“We never started investing in climate because other VCs were investing. It’s not like we’re going to stop now because others have,” said Pai.
Climate tech is an umbrella term that includes electric vehicles, sustainable agriculture, water management, circular economy models, waste recycling and more.
In India, climate-focused venture capital has leaned heavily towards EVs and mobility, while private equity has largely backed renewable energy plays. Between 2022 and 2025, among the 10 largest climate-tech deals by venture capital, eight were in EVs.
Most of Rainmatter’s climate-tech bets have spanned companies focused on recycling agricultural waste, climate insights, climate financing and controlled farming. Alt Mat, Amwoodo, Aurassure, Climes and Ossus Bio are among the companies in its portfolio.
“We’ve been conscious that EV and mobility have had a lot of access to capital. We’re focused on other sectors where capital is lacking,” Pai said.
From its climate portfolio, dairy brand Akshaykalpa has been a breakout. Rainmatter first invested when Akshaykalpa raised $15 million in a Series B in 2022, and also participated in the company’s $12 million Series C.
Rainmatter has around 142 investments across fintech (35), health and fitness (41), media (8), climate (43) and another 15 in other industries. Overall, Rainmatter’s assets under management (AUM) are roughly₹1,600 crore.
Rainmatter's AIF has a long duration, set at 15 years with an option to extend it for two more years. It's all a part of how the firm sees itself as a patient player in the country's startup ecosystem.
“When we reach the end, we can figure out if we want to do a continuation, if at all,” said Pai. “We don't want to push some of these companies to give us exits.”
Since the Zerodha-backed fund does not have a limited partner structure, Pai said Rainmatter can deploy capital with a longer horizon and without the pressure that time-bound VC funds face to push founders towards exits within tight timelines. He, however, said that exits still matter for the fund, stating that “distributions are as important as investing”.
Across its portfolio of companies, Rainmatter hasn't fully exited any of its investments, according to Pai. It partially exited its investment in credit card management platform CRED through a secondary round. Apart from that, the firm declined to name other companies where it has made partial exits.
The decision to back companies was born out of Zerodha founders Nikhil Kamath and Nithin Kamath wanting to support entrepreneurs in the country. “The idea was more about building an ecosystem and supporting more entrepreneurs who are solving for problems that we see around us and don't get VC capital because they aren't high growth and scale,” Pai said.
That flexibility on time and returns has coincided with an increase in deal-making. Over the past two years, Rainmatter has entered the list of the most active investors tracked by Venture Intelligence, with the dataset showing about 24 investments in 2025 and 28 in 2024.
Pai said Rainmatter deployed about₹400-450 crore over the past year, but stressed there are no internal targets for next year’s pace of fund deployment.

For senior and middle management, the path to a new corner office in 2026 will be defined by gruelling vetting processes, artificial intelligence litmus tests, and a ""last-in, first-out"" anxiety that is keeping potential candidates from jumping ship.
The shift marks a departure from the aggressive expansion seen in previous years. Executive search firms said that the timeline to close a senior mandate now frequently exceeds six months, as boards prioritize operational resilience over headcount growth.
In a bid to de-risk high-stakes appointments, hiring panels are increasingly looking outside their own industries. The goal is to find ""disruptors""—leaders who have navigated market volatility or digital transformation in other sectors and can apply those lessons to new environments.
This scrutiny has introduced new hurdles for candidates, including psychometric testing. Once reserved for the top rung, these assessments are now standard for middle management.
""Peer group evaluations are now done in seven out of 10 mandates at the middle and senior levels,"" says Pranshu Upadhyay, regional director at Michael Page India. This involves interviewing a candidate's to-be colleagues and subordinates to gauge cultural fit and soft skills.
The ""lethargy"" in the market is also driven by candidate hesitation. With global macroeconomic jitters persisting, many executives fear the ""last man in, first man out"" phenomenon, where the newest hires are the first to be pruned during a downturn.
The slowdown is visible in the data. While the previous fiscal year saw a 30% to 40% surge in CXO mandates, that growth is expected to crater to just 10% in the coming year, according to Upasana Agarwal, partner at ABC Consultants. ""Companies want to retain existing talent because the cost of business loss during a six-month vacancy is too high,"" she noted.
The hiring lag is particularly acute in the startup ecosystem. Backed by private equity and venture capital, these firms now require multiple rounds of global stakeholder approvals before signing off on a new lead.
However, the news isn't entirely grim. While traditional roles are stagnating, a new class of ""AI-native"" positions is emerging. Roles such as AI ethicists, virtual reality experience managers, and AI tutors are beginning to surface in recruitment briefs, offering a silver lining to the otherwise muted outlook.
""Hiring in 2026 will remain highly cautious,"" said Manu Saigal, country manager at Hays. ""Global hiring momentum is slow, and that sentiment is spilling into India. CXOs will face growing pressure to demonstrate how they can drive resilience rather than just expansion.""

Financial terms of its transaction with Manus were not released, but a source with direct knowledge of the matter said the deal values the Singapore-based firm at between $2 billion and $3 billion.
Once hailed as China's next DeepSeek, Manus went viral earlier this year on X by releasing what it claimed to be the world's first general AI agent, capable of making decisions and executing tasks autonomously, with much less prompting required than AI chatbots.
Beijing has since shown interest in supporting Manus, which claims performance of its AI agent surpasses that of OpenAI's DeepResearch. The company also has a strategic partnership with Alibaba to collaborate on their AI models.
Meta will operate and sell the Manus service and integrate it into its consumer and business products, including in Meta AI, the company said.
Tech giants such as Meta have been ramping up AI investments through strategic acquisitions and talent hires as they navigate fierce industry competition. Earlier this year, the Facebook-owner invested in Scale AI in a deal that valued the data-labeling startup at $29 billion and brought in its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang.
Manus, backed by its parent Beijing Butterfly Effect Technology, raised $75 million this year at a valuation of around $500 million, according to media reports. U.S. venture firm Benchmark led the funding round.
It is among a flurry of Chinese firms that have domiciled in Singapore in recent years, betting a move to the trade-focused city-state would reduce risks their operations get disrupted by Sino-U.S. geopolitical tensions.
