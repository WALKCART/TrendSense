So far this month, silver has gained a massive 62%, after closing 2025 with a whopping 170% gain.
The US Dollar Index, which measures the currency against six major peers, rose 0.3% to 96.216, but remained near four-year lows. The currency crashed 1.28% to reach a four-year low in Tuesday's session after US President Trump said he was not concerned about the currency’s recent decline, adding that it had not fallen too much.
The dollar’s fall was also driven by Trump’s comments that he will soon announce his pick to serve as head of the Fed and his prediction that interest rates would decline once the new chair takes over.
Gold, which does not yield interest, typically performs well when interest rates are low. In addition, growing speculation over a potential joint US-Japan currency intervention to support the yen weighed further on the dollar.
The world’s reserve currency fell over 9% in 2025, marking its steepest annual decline since 2017, with losses further extending into early 2026, falling another 2.07% so far.
The Fed voted to lower the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point at each of these gatherings, bringing rates to a range between 3.50% and 3.75%.
However, investors will closely track cues about the timing of future cuts. The recent rate cuts announced by the US Fed were backed by a cooling labour market. Analysts, however, expect solid GDP growth, relatively low unemployment, and stubborn inflation will lead Fed officials to adopt a wait-and-see approach.

In pre-market trade, three key benchmarks were trading higher. S&P 500 futures rose 0.17%, Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.79%, largely led by tech stocks, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell marginally by 0.02%,
The meeting also comes as the Fed faces sharp challenges from President Donald Trump's administration, sparking concerns that its independence from politics could be threatened.
Economists, however, expect policymakers to hold firm as they assess the effects of the three consecutive rate cuts that brought the benchmark lending rate to a range between 3.50% and 3.75%,AFPreported.
Financial markets generally expect the Fed to continue keeping rates unchanged until its June meeting, according to CME FedWatch.
The recent rate cuts announced by the US Fed were backed by a cooling labour market. However, analysts expect solid GDP growth, relatively low unemployment, and stubborn inflation will lead Fed officials to adopt a wait-and-see approach.
Trump has sharply escalated pressure on the Fed since returning to the White House a year ago, seeking to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations, while his administration launched an investigation into Chairman Jerome Powell.
In a rare rebuke this month, Powell slammed the threat of criminal charges against him—over the Fed's headquarters renovation—as a threat to central bank independence.
US Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran said on Tuesday he saw the need for a significant drop in interest rates in 2026, advocating for a larger decline than the central bank has so far signalled, according toAFP.
Miran was appointed by President Donald Trump last year for a term lasting until late January, as the US leader publicly criticised the Fed for not cutting rates more rapidly.
The Fed voted to lower the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point at each of these gatherings, bringing rates to a range between 3.50% and 3.75%. Miran voted for a larger half-percentage-point cut on each occasion.

The US President's remarks were weighed further on investor sentiment, keeping the greenback under pressure. At its core, the dollar's strength rests on confidence — in the stability of US policy, and in the currency's role as the world's safest and most liquid asset.
Traders are also closely watching the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, hoping for clues on the future path of interest rates, as uncertainty over the Trump administration's policies persists following its latest tariff threats, adding to volatility in currency markets.
These reports further led to speculation that the White House was prepared to let the dollar weaken further, and President Trump did not outrightly dismiss the speculation when asked on Tuesday if he was worried about the US currency's decline.
“No, I think it's great,” he told reporters in Iowa after the unit hit its weakest level against the euro in four-and-a-half years and a two-and-half-month low against the yen. “Look at the business we're doing. The dollar's doing great.”
He further added: “I want it to be — just seek its own level, which is the fair thing to do.”

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will consider various economic indicators, such as inflation trends and labour market conditions, before announcing interest rates. After the meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will make a statement and address the press conference.
For the first month of the year, the two-day FOMC meeting was scheduled for 27-28 January 2026. The policy statement will be issued at 2 pm ET on January 28.
In the last FOMC meeting, it was decided to cut its key benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, 10 December 2025.
The Fed decided to cut the interest rate to 3.50%-3.75%, marking a 25-basis-point rate cut on 10 December 2025, amid elevated US inflation and a weakening job market.
All eyes are now on the US Federal Reserve's FOMC and Chairman Jerome Powell, as the central bank will announce its policy decision.
People around the world are awaiting the US Federal Reserve FOMC's two-day policy meeting outcome, which will determine the key interest rates for the US economy.
In the last FOMC meeting, it was decided to cut its key benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points.
The speech will also be broadcast live on the Federal Reserve’s official YouTube channel on Wednesday — https://www.youtube.com/federalreserve.
People are awaiting the US Federal Reserve's first policy decision of the year, which the central bank will announce at 12:30 a.m. (IST), which will be one hour later than usual due to the Daylight Saving Time (DST) in the United States.
In the US, people will be able to see the Fed's policy outcome at 2:00 p.m. (EDT), as per the official data.
Although the US Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on 10 December 2025, for the third time in 2025, the 3.50% to 3.75% interest rate came on the backdrop of elevated inflation in the US economy and slowing job growth in the country.
“Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up through September. More recent indicators are consistent with these developments. Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated,” said the FOMC on 10 December 2025.
At the December FOMC meeting, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the current overshooting of the central bank's 2% inflation target is mostly due to President Donald Trump's import tax hikes.
""It's really tariffs that are causing most of the inflation overshoot,"" Powell said after the last Fed meeting.
According to December 2025 data, the unemployment rate in the United States stands at 4.4%.
As of November 2025, the inflation rate in the United States stands at 2.8%, higher than the Fed's target range of 2%.
Since the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, policymakers keep a close watch on the unemployment rate. This helps them determine whether the US economy is near or at maximum employment and guides decisions on the appropriate interest rates to support employment while ensuring price stability.
The Federal Reserve seeks to achieve inflation of 2% over the longer run, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).
Federal Reserve policymakers keep a close eye on inflation rates and modify monetary policies to aim for their target, all while supporting the objective of maximum employment. The central bank has the a dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the Americans.
Any change to the key interest rates impacts short-term interest rates across various financial assets. These changes influence the spending choices of households and businesses, thereby affecting overall economic activity, employment levels, and inflation rates.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets a target range for the key in. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings each year and announces its policy decisions at 2 pm (ET) on the second day of each meeting.
US Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran on Tuesday said he sees the need for a substantial rate cut in 2026, advocating a larger decrease than the central bank has so far indicated, according to AFP.
Financial markets generally expect the Fed to maintain interest rates at current levels until its June meeting, according to CME FedWatch.
Economists anticipate policymakers will keep rates steady as they evaluate the impact of the three consecutive rate cuts that reduced the benchmark lending rate to a range of 3.50% to 3.75%, AFP reported.
The euro fell against the dollar on Wednesday as traders awaited the US Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision, AFP reported.
The FOMC meeting is scheduled for January 27–28. The policy statement will be released at 2 pm ET on January 28, followed by a press conference with Powell.
Jerome Powell’s press conference address will live stream on the US Federal Reserve’s website: https://www.federalreserve.gov/.
His speech will also be broadcast live on the Federal Reserve’s official YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/federalreserve.
US Fed Meeting 2026 LIVE: US Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell in his address to the press after the December 2025 policy announcement said that the central bank is not looking to hike its key interest rates anytime soon amid the overall closer to neutral stance, in line with its dual mandate.
“I don't think that a rate hike is anybody's base as the next thing is anybody's base case at this point, I'm not hearing that. What you see is some people feel we should stop here and that we're at the right place and just wait,” said Powell during his press address.
US Fed Meeting 2026 LIVE: Nine out of the 12 federal open market committee (FOMC) members voted in favour of the US Fed's policy decision to cut the key interest rates.
One official out of the remaining three was seeking a 50 basis point rate cut, while the other two wanted to keep the interest rates unchanged at their previous levels.
The key benchmark interest rates were cut by 25 basis points to the range of 3.50% to 3.75% after the December 2025 policy outcome.
U.S. stocks rose in early trading on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 surpassing 7,000 for the first time ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and earnings announcement from major companies like Microsoft, Tesla, and Meta Platforms.
Trump has significantly increased pressure on the Fed since returning to the White House a year ago, primarily to cut rates, raising questions about the independence of the central bank.
The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady this time amid solid GDP growth, relatively low unemployment, and current inflation levels, which have given them reason to shift into a wait-and-see mode, AFP reported.
It is widely anticipated that the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged, despite President Donald Trump's urging for more cuts, AFP reported.
Gold, a safe-haven asset, generally performs well during times of low interest rates and increased uncertainty. It has risen by more than 20% since the beginning of the year, continuing the record gains seen last year.
Inflation remains persistently above the Fed’s 2% target, and decreasing interest rates might further raise prices for U.S. consumers while supporting economic growth. Traders expect the Fed to resume rate cuts later this year, AP reported.
On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said that he would soon announce his pick to replace Powell, whose term as chair ends in May, Reuters reported.
Gold prices rose above $5,300 per ounce on Wednesday for the first time, boosted by economic uncertainty and a weakening U.S. dollar, as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's policy decision amidst growing concerns about its independence, Reuters reported.
In India, the FOMC decision will be announced on Thursday, 29 January at 12:30 am (IST), an hour later than usual due to Daylight Saving Time in the US. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks after the FOMC policy decision will be streamed at 1:00 am (IST) on Thursday, as per the official schedule.
""It's really tariffs that are causing most of the inflation overshoot,"" Powell said after the December Fed meeting, reiterating his expectation that the tariff impact on inflation is likely to be a ""one-time price increase.""
This week’s meeting is the Fed’s first in 2026, a year marked by major transitions. A new chair is expected after Powell’s term concludes in May amid growing political pressure.
As Jerome Powell's tenure as Fed Chair ends soon, Trump was questioned on whether he would remain at the US central bank as its governor for another two years.
“We live with the cards you’re dealt,” he said. “If that happens, his life won’t be very, very happy, I don’t think, by doing it. I think he wants to get out. He has not done a good job,"" Trump told CNBC.
At the October FOMC meeting, the US Federal Reserve decided to cut the key interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 3.75% to 4.00%, for the second time in the calendar year, amid elevated inflation and the US government shutdown.
After the December policy announcement, Trump said the rate cut could be “at least” twice as large as what was delivered and added that he wants the next Fed chair to be someone “honest” about interest rates.
At the December meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank will either maintain or cut interest rates at the next Fed meeting next year, as the Fed adopts a wait-and-see approach based on forthcoming economic data.
Jerome Powell’s press conference address will be live-streamed on the US Federal Reserve’s website: https://www.federalreserve.gov/.
The speech will also be broadcast live on the Federal Reserve’s official YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/federalreserve.
Akshat Garg, Head, Research & Product, Choice Wealth, said, “Inflation is generally behaving—hovering near 2.7%—but it isn't completely vanquished, and the labour market is cooling down without falling off a cliff, so there is simply no economic emergency requiring immediate action right now. Plus, amidst all the noise about political pressure, holding steady is a quiet power move that reasserts the Fed's independence. Expect them to signal that while the cutting cycle isn't dead, they are perfectly comfortable sitting on their hands until the economic picture clears up, likely eyeing the summer for their next move.”
Akshat Garg, Head, Research & Product, Choice Wealth, said, ""If you’re watching the Federal Reserve this week hoping for another quick rate cut, you might want to adjust your expectations. All signs point to the central bank hitting the pause button at this week's meeting, likely holding rates steady in the 3.50%–3.75% range. Think of this as a strategic ""wait-and-see"" moment rather than a change in direction. After aggressively cutting rates late last year, Chair Powell and his team need a moment to catch their breath and let those previous adjustments actually work their way through the plumbing of the economy.""
The Fed decided to cut the interest rate to 3.50% to 3.75%, marking a 25 basis point rate cut on 10 December 2025, amid elevated US inflation and a weakening job market.
The FOMC has reduced interest rates by 25 basis points at each of its last three meetings to prevent a cooling labour market from slipping into rising unemployment.
Market experts anticipate that the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates steady after the two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Meanwhile, media reports indicate that the central bank is facing political pressure from the Trump administration to cut rates.
In India, the FOMC decision will be announced on Thursday, 29 January at 12:30 am (IST), an hour later than usual due to Daylight Saving Time in the US. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks after the FOMC policy decision will be streamed at 1:00 am (IST) on Thursday, as per the official schedule.

livemint,markets,Floating Rate Savings Bond is offering 8.05% return in a low-interest-rate regime: Should you invest?,"The FRSB, 2020 (T) is offering a higher interest rate of 8.05% p.a. compared to bank fixed deposit rates of 6.50% to 7.00%. It has a 7-year tenure with low liquidity.",https://www.livemint.com/market/bonds/floating-rate-savings-bond-is-offering-8-05-return-in-a-low-interest-rate-regime-should-you-invest-11769599113461.html,2026-01-28 11:23:57,"With the latest 25 basis point cut announced at the December policy meeting, the RBI has lowered the repo rate to 5.25% from 5.50%. In response, banks have steadily reduced fixed deposit rates. Currently, most large banks offer interest rates of 6.50%-7.00% on fixed deposits with tenures ranging from one to five years.
The Floating Rate Savings Bond, 2020 (Taxable) is a bond issued by the Central Government, with a floating interest rate linked to the National Savings Certificate (NSC) interest rate. It currently pays an interest rate of 8.05% p.a., and has the highest safety as it is issued by the Central Government. In short, it is referred to as FRSB, 2020(T). The bond’s tenure is seven years.
Any individual who is resident in India can apply for the bond. The minimum investment amount is₹1,000 and in multiples thereof. There is no maximum limit on the amount an individual can invest in the bonds.
The FRSB, 2020(T) interest rate is linked/pegged to the prevailing interest rate on the National Savings Certificate (NSC). The bond interest rate has a spread of (+) 35 basis points over the respective NSC interest rate. Currently, the interest rate payable on NSC is 7.70% p.a. (Jan to Mar 2025). Hence, the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is 8.05% p.a. (NSC interest rate 7.70% + 0.35% spread).
The interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is reset half-yearly on every 1st January and 1st July, based on the prevailing NSC interest rate on 1st January and 1st July, with a spread of (+) 35 basis points. As the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is subject to change on a half-yearly basis, based on the prevailing NSC interest rate, it is a floating interest rate product.
As and when the NSC interest rate is revised upwards, the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is revised upwards. Similarly, as and when the NSC interest rate is revised downwards, the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is revised downwards. As mentioned earlier, the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is reset on 1st January and 1st July every year.
The interest on the FRSB, 2020(T) is paid at half-yearly intervals on 1st January and 1st July. For example, the interest amount for the period 1st January to 30th June is paid on 1st July. Similarly, the interest amount for the period 1st July to 31st December is paid on 1st January. There is no option to pay interest on a monthly, quarterly, yearly, or cumulative basis.
The half-yearly interest amount is credited to the bondholder’s bank account. The interest amount payment is subject to Tax Deduction at Source (TDS). The tax will not be deducted if the bondholder has made a declaration of tax exemption.
The interest earned on the bond is taxable. The interest amount is added to the individual’s income and taxed as per the individual’s tax slab.
An individual can apply for the FRSB, 2020(T) by submitting the duly filled application form online or in physical format at the authorised branches of:
The application must be submitted along with the payment. The payment can be made by cheque, draft, cash (up to Rs. 20,000), or any electronic mode acceptable to the bank. The bonds are issued to the bondholder in electronic format and are credited to the investor’s Bond Ledger Account (BLA). The bondholder will be issued a certificate of holding as proof of subscription.
The bondholder can nominate one or more persons as nominees by submitting Form C. A new nomination can be made, or an existing nomination can be cancelled by submitting Form D.
The FRSB, 2020(T), is not tradable in the secondary market. They are not eligible as collateral for availing loans from banks, financial institutions, and NBFCs. The bonds cannot be transferred, except to the nominee(s) / legal heir(s), in the event of the bondholder’s death.
The bonds are repayable on completion of the seven-year tenure from the date of issue. Premature encashment is allowed only for individuals aged 60 years and above, subject to certain conditions. On maturity, the redemption amount is credited to the bondholder’s bank account.
As mentioned earlier, most big banks are currently paying interest rates of 6.50% to 7.00% on fixed deposits with a tenure of 1 to 5 years. In the last one year, the RBI has reduced the Repo Rate by 125 basis points, from 6.50% (Jan 2025) to 5.25% (Dec 2025).
Following the RBI’s repo rate cuts, banks have also cut interest rates on their fixed deposits. Compared to the current interest rates of 6.50% to 7.00% on bank fixed deposits, the FRSB, 2020(T) offers a better interest rate of 8.05%. Based on interest rate comparison, the FRSB, 2020(T) comes out as a better investment product.
Also, if we look at the history of the NSC interest rates, the Government has held the NSC interest rates steady at 7.70% for the last three years (from Apr 2023 to Mar 2026). However, there is no guarantee that the Government will not cut interest rates in future.
You need to bear in mind that the FRSB, 2020(T) is a floating interest rate product. If the Government decides to cut the interest rates on the NSC in future, the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) will also move lower. Also, the investment tenure of the FRSB, 2020(T) is seven years with low liquidity. An investor must consider these factors when deciding whether they should invest in the FRSB, 2020(T).

livemint,markets,"Budget 2026: Growth to stay in focus, but tax relief unlikely","As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to unveil Budget 2026, expectations are set for a significant increase in defence spending and continued public investment to bolster economic growth. However, tax relief appears unlikely amid revenue constraints and global uncertainties.&amp;nbsp;",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/budget-2026-growth-to-stay-in-focus-but-tax-relief-unlikely-11769598568455.html,2026-01-28 11:17:19,"Finance Minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting her record ninth consecutive Budget on February 1st 2026, in the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions in a VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) world.
Despite Trump tariffs, the Indian economy has done well and is poised to clock a GDP growth of 7.4% in FY26.
The average annual GDP growth during FY22 to FY26, factoring in the estimated 7.4% GDP growth for FY26, is an impressive 8.1%, assisted, of course, by the low base of the Covid year FY20-21. Inflation, the fiscal deficit, and the current account deficit are under control.
The fact that India has achieved this impressive growth while maintaining financial stability enhances the quality of its growth.
Even though the US-India trade deal is still hanging fire, the mega India–EU trade deal has come as a shot in the arm for the economy.
While the macros paint a robust picture, the micros are struggling. The impressive 24% CAGR in corporate earnings from FY21 to FY24 suddenly took a turn for the worse, dipping to 5% in FY25, pushing market valuations to elevated levels.
The AI trade, which dominated global stock markets in 2025, and the massive FII selling of $18 billion made India a huge underperformer in 2025.
There is a clamour for tax relief from investors. There is a view that tax reliefs are needed to bring FIIs back to the Indian market. Can the FM provide tax relief?
The year 2025 was a year of bold reforms. Budget 2025 raised the income tax exemption limit to₹12 lakhs, GST rates were cut and rationalised in September 2025, and four new labour codes- consolidating existing 29 labour laws- were implemented in November.
The RBI gave a big push to growth by cutting interest rates four times in 2025 by an aggregate of 1.25%. These fiscal and monetary stimuli have succeeded in pushing growth to an estimated 7.4% in FY26.
However, the low inflation rate has dragged the nominal growth rate down to an estimated 8.2% in FY26 against the Budget estimates of 10.1%.
The government is likely to face a revenue shortfall of around₹3 lakh crore in FY26. In this context of revenue constraints, it would be unrealistic to expect significant tax reliefs.
The income tax relief provided last year by raising the exemption limit to₹12 lakhs was much better than expected.
It is important to understand that India’s per capita income is around₹2,40,000. The exemption limit of₹12 lakhs means that even if a person earns five times the per capita income, she need not pay tax.
This is fair taxation, and therefore, it would be unrealistic to expect further relief in income tax. Corporate tax, too, is fair, and changes are unlikely.
The long-term capital gains (LTCGs) tax, reintroduced in 2018, was rationalised in the 2025 Budget by fixing the rate at 12.5%, thereby making the tax uniform across all asset classes like equity, equity-oriented mutual funds, gold and real estate.
A change in this tax rate is unlikely within a year. Exemption of FIIs from LTCGs, like in many countries, would be a huge positive for markets, but this is unlikely since it requires the abolition of the LTCGs tax.
However, there is scope for raising the tax-exemption limit for LTCGs from the present 1.25 lakhs to a higher level.
Fiscal consolidation has been a major success of the NDA government. The fiscal deficit has been brought down from 9.2% in FY21 to 4.5% in FY25.
The target for FY27 is likely to be 4.3% in FY27. From FY27 onwards, the government will be changing the matrix of fiscal discipline by moving from the present fiscal deficit to GDP ratio to debt to GDP ratio.
The FM is expected to target 55.5% debt to GDP with a commitment to bring it down to 50% by 2030.
The Budget will be carefully watched for the expenditure priorities. In the context of ‘Operation Sindoor’ and global geopolitical tensions, the defence outlay is likely to be increased by more than 20%.
From the market perspective, this will again put defence stocks in the limelight. In the context of languishing private capex, the FM will continue increasing public capex, even under revenue constraints.
This will be positive for infra stocks. The focus of the Budget will be growth, not tax relief.
Given the volatile global geopolitical context, the continuing 50% US tariffs on India, and the elusive US-India trade agreement, the FM has to do a fine balancing act to sustain high economic growth by increasing expenditure wherever required, even while maintaining fiscal discipline.
The FM has proved through her previous Budgets that she has the economic acumen and political savvy to deliver a fine balancing act. Let’s keep our fingers crossed.

On Tuesday, the rupee rebounded from its all-time low levels and gained 22 paise to close at 91.68 against the US dollar.
Forex traders said the rupee opened higher as the US dollar index softened and a long-awaited trade breakthrough with Europe bolstered investor sentiment.
India and the European Union on Tuesday announced the conclusion of negotiations for the free trade agreement (FTA), under which a number of domestic sectors such as apparel, chemicals and footwear will get duty-free entry into the 27-nation bloc, while the EU will get access to the Indian market at concessional duty for cars and wines, an official said.
The deal has been dubbed the ""mother of all deals"" as it will create a market of about 2 billion people.

livemint,markets,Dalal Street Reality Check: India-EU trade deal is historic but it can't replace India-US deal - here's why,"India's Free Trade Agreement with the EU, finalized on January 26, 2026, enhances trade relations and positions India favorably in global markets, but experts caution it does not replace the need for an India-US trade deal, which remains crucial for Indian exporters.",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/dalal-street-reality-check-india-eu-trade-deal-is-historic-but-it-cant-replace-india-us-trade-deal-explained-11769596183677.html,2026-01-28 10:42:00,"India-EU free trade agreement: India’s Free Trade Agreement with the European Union, finalised on January 26, 2026, marks one of the most consequential trade alliances in recent history. Covering economies that together represent nearly 25 % of global GDP and 33 % of global trade, the agreement is expected to accelerate India’s integration into global supply chains and strengthen its long-term export competitiveness.
Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist at CareEdge Ratings, believes the agreement will materially benefit India’s labour-intensive sectors and services exports, particularly through improved mobility, digital services access and deeper participation in global value chains. At the same time, she has cautioned that increased market access will expose domestic players to tougher competition, making execution and cost efficiency critical for listed companies.
Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital, has highlighted that while the EU deal expands opportunity, it also serves a different purpose — providing alternative markets for products traditionally exported to the US. The agreement helps hedge against US tariff uncertainty, but it does not replicate the earnings intensity or market depth that US exposure provides to Indian corporates.
Adding to this perspective, Munjal Almoula, Managing Partner – Tax & Regulatory Advisory at BDO India, has emphasised the strategic design of the pact. The India-EU FTA is structured as a “living agreement”, incorporating digital trade, advanced manufacturing collaboration and sustainability mechanisms. This enhances long-term competitiveness but also underscores why benefits will accrue over multiple years rather than trigger an immediate market rerating.
For investors, the takeaway is nuanced. The India-EU trade deal strengthens India’s long-term structural growth narrative, supports export-oriented manufacturing and reinforces the China-plus-one theme. Over time, this can translate into steadier earnings growth and improved global positioning for select sectors.
However, markets should not conflate strategic diversification with economic substitution. The US remains India’s most critical trade partner from an equity-market perspective, and any progress on an India-US trade deal would likely have a sharper and more immediate impact on earnings upgrades, foreign inflows and market sentiment.
In short, Brussels matters — but Washington still moves Dalal Street more decisively. The India-EU deal is a powerful complement, not a replacement, and investors would do well to position portfolios with that distinction firmly in mind.

livemint,markets,Asian Paints: Why is investor confidence peeling off despite robust margins?,"Management highlighted changes in consumption patterns such as the growing number of destination weddings leading to postponement of home paintings in the wedding season, and less frequent painting in general as consumers shift to other discretionary spends.",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/asian-paints-q3-results-shares-fall-volume-growth-slows-11769589594777.html,2026-01-28 10:27:00,"Asian Paints Ltd’s shares fell around 5% on Wednesday after the company announced its earnings for the December quarter (Q3FY26). Though profit margins were a bright spot, the company failed to sustain its 10.9% growth in domestic decorative paint volume from Q2, which came after five quarters of lucklustre growth.
Domestic decorative paint volume, Asian Paints’s backbone, grew 7.9% year-on-year In Q3, with value growth at 2.8%. A shorter festive period (just 15 days) and a prolonged monsoon in October played spoilsport. Consolidated revenue grew just 3.7% year-on-year to₹8,867 crore.
Management said in the earnings call that volumes in November and December were significantly stronger than the quarterly average, suggesting an improving trend towards the end of Q3. Near-term volume growth is seen at 8-10%, aided by steady demand from both the consumer and industrial segments.
That said, management highlighted changes in consumption patterns such as the growing number of destination weddings leading to postponement of home paintings in the wedding season, and less frequent painting in general as consumers shift to other discretionary spends. These are likely leading to weak industry sales growth compared to the healthy double-digit growth of the past.
Asian Paints’ volume-value gap of 4-5% is likely to persist because of an unfavourable product mix (higher growth is likely in putty, construction chemicals and waterproofing products). This could limit overall revenue growth to the mid-single-digits.
Gross margin and Ebitda margin both hit multi-quarter highs in Q3. Gross margin at 44.4% was aided by lower raw material costs and a larger share of premium products. Ebitda margin surpassed 20% for the first time in eight quarters. Asian Paints retained its Ebitda margin guidance of 18-20%, supported by continued cost efficiencies, stable input prices, and benefits expected from backward integration projects over the medium-term.
Nomura Global Markets Research analysts said the company could see operating margin remain at the higher-end of the guided band. However, its near-term guidance of mid-single-digit value growth and double-digit volume growth may not excite the Street, said the Nomura report dated 27 January. Factoring in the guidance, Nomura cut its FY27 and FY28 earnings per share estimates by 2.4% and 0.2%, respectively.
Asian Paints will continue to invest in marketing and strengthen brand equity as it expects competition to remain elevated. It currently does not foresee price changes, but is confident of market-share gains through innovation. It continues to expand its distribution reach, having added 3,500-4,000 retailers over 9MFY26 with more than 160,000 retail touchpoints.

Extending gains to the second consecutive session, the Sensex settled 487 points, or 0.60%, higher at 82,344.68, while the Nifty 50 closed the day at 25,342.75, rising 167 points, or 0.66%.
The mid and small-cap segments outperformed as the BSE Midcap 150 index jumped 1.69%, while the Smallcap 250 index surged 1.81%.
Strong gains in the market made investors richer by about₹6 lakh crore in a single session as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms jumped to nearly₹460 lakh crore from nearly₹454 lakh crore in the previous session.
The domestic market saw healthy gains on short covering as an India-EU free trade agreement influenced sentiment.
""Domestic markets displayed continued optimism, supported by the India–EU FTA,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, noted.
Ajit Mishra, SVP- Research at Religare Broking, said apart from the continued rub-off from the India–EU FTA, positive global cues, including a weaker U.S. dollar and supportive moves in global indices, helped bolster sentiment.
""Short-covering and renewed buying interest across sectors added to the positive momentum, while company-specific triggers, including notable gains in select heavyweight stocks, further supported the upside,"" Mishra said.
As many as 32 stocks ended higher in the Nifty 50 index, among which Bharat Electronics (BEL) (up 9.21%), ONGC (up 8.18%), and Coal India (up 5.27%) ended at the top.
Tata Consumer (down 4.55%), Asian Paints (down 4.22%), and Maruti Suzuki India (down 2.39%) ended as the top losers in the index.
Barring Nifty FMCG (down 0.71%), Pharma (down 0.22%), and Healthcare (down 0.20%), all sectoral indices ended higher.
Nifty Oil and Gas (up 3.40%) ended at the top, followed by Metal (up 2.34%), Media (up 2.13%), PSU Bank (up 1.68%), and Realty (up 1.57%).
Nifty Bank jumped 0.66% to end at 59,598.80. The Financial Services index rose by 1%.
Vodafone Idea (64.5 crore shares), Tata Silver Exchange Traded Fund (64 crore shares), and Tata Gold Exchange Traded Fund (27.4 crore shares) were the most active counters in terms of volume on the NSE.
The advance-decline ratio remained in favour of advancers as over 2,900 stocks advanced while over 1,300 declined on the BSE.
Sterlite Technologies, Redtape, Mahindra Logistics, Shilchar Technologies, Paras Petrofils, Omax Autos, Meera Industries, and Infobeans Technologies were among the 17 stocks that jumped more than 15% on the BSE.
Axis Bank, BEL, SBI, Tata Steel, and Tech Mahindra were among the 86 stocks that hit their 52-week highs in intraday trade on the BSE.
As many as 261 stocks, including Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Patanjali Foods, Syngene International, Brigade Enterprises, Jyothy Labs, and Akzo Nobel India, hit their 52-week lows on the BSE.
According to Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities, 25,200 would act as a key support level for the Nifty 50. Above this level, the pullback rally could continue till 25,500.
Chouhan said further upside may also continue, potentially lifting the index to 25,575. However, below 25,200, sentiment could change, and traders may prefer to exit their long positions.
Mishra of Religare Broking pointed out that the Nifty settled at a crucial juncture around the 25,350 level, and a decisive breakout could help extend the rebound towards the 25,600 zone.
On the downside, the long-term moving average, the 200 DEMA around 25,150, remains critical to hold; a breakdown below this level could see the corrective phase resume, Mishra said.

livemint,markets,Vodafone Idea emerges from AGR storm: Kumar Mangalam Birla calls it 'an idea whose time has come',"Vodafone Idea, created following the merger of UK-based Vodafone and India's Idea Cellular in 2018, has weathered a long-period of uncertainty in India’s telecom history.",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/vodafone-idea-emerges-from-agr-storm-kumar-mangalam-birla-calls-it-an-idea-whose-time-has-come-11769593833992.html,2026-01-28 09:55:57,"In his seventh annual reflection, Birla described AGR resolution as a turning point that has fundamentally altered Vodafone Idea's operating environment.
""For the first time in years, the fog has cleared, allowing the business to look beyond survival and focus on sustainable growth,"" Birla wrote.
Vodafone Idea, created following the merger of UK-based Vodafone and India's Idea Cellular in 2018, has weathered a long-period of uncertainty in India’s telecom history.
Burdened by AGR dues, intense competition, and operational challenges, Vodafone Idea’s future was uncertain, raising broader concerns about the country’s telecom sector.
Vodafone Idea got a breather from the government on payment of its AGR dues as the Cabinet decided to freeze them at₹87,695 crore. The government had approved the payment plan for the company to clear its frozen AGR dues between FY32 and FY41.
As per the Supreme Court orders in October and November, the government has also begun the exercise to reassess the company's AGR dues. Upon completion of the exercise, the final AGR amount of the company could be reduced as well, according to analysts and government officials.
""The Vodafone Idea experience underlines my belief that Tough Times Don’t Last. Tough Companies Do,"" Birla wrote, attributing the commitment of employees, loyalty of customers and the belief of business partners and shareholders as the factors that carried Vodafone Idea through this turbulent and uncertain time in the company's history.
""Equally vital was the government’s unflinching determination to revitalise the telecom sector, coupled with the firm conviction of the promoters on the long-term potential of the Indian telecom sector. A dogged focus on daily operations, service and network expansion, will now serve as the foundation for revival,"" he said.
Birla emphasised the strategic importance of a competitive telecom industry for India’s digital future.
He stated, “A healthy, competitive telecom industry is essential to India’s digital future. India deserves 3 private telecom players. India deserves a successful Vodafone Idea. And this is, once again, an idea whose time has come.""
During the quarter, the company lost 3.8 million subscribers, taking its subscriber base to 192.9 million as of the end of December. Meanwhile, its average revenue per user (Arpu) grew 3% sequentially to₹172 a month, led by consumer upgrades.

Silver ETFs mirrored the rally in the underlying metal. Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, Zerodha Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Silver ETF and Nippon India Silver ETF gained over 6% each during the session.
Meanwhile, 360 ONE Silver ETF, Groww Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF and several others advanced more than 5%.
Commenting on the outlook, Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst at IndusInd Securities, said silver ETF prices could remain volatile in the near term, potentially moving more sharply than spot silver if leveraged or sentiment-driven flows intensify.
“Structural supply constraints, as silver is largely a by-product of other metals and cannot be easily ramped up, continue to support prices. Strong industrial demand from sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles, electronics and emerging technology applications, along with safe-haven buying amid macroeconomic uncertainty and low or negative real yields, are further positives,” Trivedi said.
According to Trivedi, the overall outlook for silver remains bullish, and silver ETFs are likely to continue witnessing healthy investor inflows.
Silver prices have significantly outpaced gold prices. While demand for silver was earlier driven largely by rising industrial consumption, investment demand has emerged as a key driver in recent months
Reflecting this trend, silver ETFs recorded inflows of₹234.7 billion in 2025, sharply higher than₹85.69 billion in the previous year. The growing popularity of silver ETFs indicates that imports for investment purposes could increase further if the ongoing price rally sustains.

livemint,markets,Budget day trading guide: Should you stay on the sidelines ahead of the mega event? Explained,"As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, experts weigh in on potential market impacts. With mixed earnings and geopolitical tensions, selective buying may be the strategy for traders, while long-term investors are advised to tread carefully.&amp;nbsp;",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/budget-2026-day-trading-strategy-should-you-stay-on-the-sidelines-ahead-of-the-mega-event-explained-11769588605751.html,2026-01-28 09:14:45,"While mixed Q3 earnings, FII selling, and geopolitical noise dominate market sentiment, the Budget remains a strong factor for the domestic market.
Investors and traders appear busy speculating what their trading and investing strategy should be for the Budget day.
Experts say the Union Budget is expected to focus on growth and fiscal consolidation. However, it may not have strong measures to boost consumption. Policy announcements may not trigger a sharp up-move in the market unless there is significant tax relief.
""Announcements on the housing front, especially affordable housing and taxation relief to FPIs, can change market sentiment,"" said Pankaj Pandey, the head of research at ICICI Securities.
Experts say that the market is witnessing stock-specific behaviour amid the Q3 results season. They suggest long-term investors should remain on the sidelines ahead of the Budget.
""This appears to be a stock-picker’s market, which is more suited for traders. Long-term investors should remain on the sidelines for now, given the lack of clarity on key macro issues, particularly the India–US trade deal,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments.
Vijayakumar said investors who are willing to take selective exposure can focus on domestic-centric sectors such as defence and capital goods.
""These sectors are less dependent on global trade and could benefit from domestic policy support and government spending,"" said Vijayakumar.
According to Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, investors can consider selective buying in equities.
""The Budget could offer better entry levels if there is disappointment, especially since the market is not expecting major reforms. Expectations are quite muted—otherwise, we would have seen a pre-Budget rally, which hasn’t happened,"" Mishra said.
The market is also expecting selective sectoral support, particularly for beaten-down sectors like textiles and export-oriented industries.
Mishra believes developments such as the EU–India trade deal and targeted Budget support could serve as short-term catalysts for these sectors.
""The market is currently focused on corporate earnings, which have been mixed this quarter. As a result, a selective investment approach is more suitable,"" said Mishra.
Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services believes there may be focus on higher capex across sectors such as defense, infrastructure, affordable housing, power, capital goods, etc..
Higher allocation to the PMAY scheme and an increase in government capex may benefit some cement stocks, Motilal Oswal said.
Measures such as a reduction of LTCG, the reintroduction of indexation benefit for debt mutual funds, no further increase in STT, and further tax slab widening and higher standard deduction may benefit AMCs, RTAs, and wealth managers, said Motilal Oswal.
According to Motilal Oswal, the following key stocks and sectors are likely to benefit if expectations play out:
L&T, ABB, Siemens, Hitachi, Siemens Energy, KEC, Bharat Electronics, Bharat Dynamics, HAL, Ultratech, JK Cement, Polycab, KEI, Crompton, Titan, PN Gadgil, Niva Bupa, AMCs, RTAs, most HFCs, MFIs, Infra players, IGL, Mahanagr Gas, Gujarat Gas, Petronet LNG, GAIL, Waaree, Premier, NTPC, Tata Power, Acme, NTPC Green, Brigade, Prestige, Sobha, Lodha, and Godrej Properties.

In the same period last year, the company had reported a net profit of₹1,092 crore.
The sharp drop in net profit for the quarter can be attributed to a significant rise in operating expenses, which jumped to₹6,114 crore from₹5,143.85 crore in the same period last year. Net profit was also impacted by a one-time charge of₹50 crore related to the implementation of the new labour codes.

They identify key sectors and stocks that could thrive under the proposed policy directions amidst external risks.",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/budget-picks-2026-axis-securities-lists-maruti-suzuki-ultratech-bharti-airtel-among-top-stocks-to-buy-ahead-of-feb-1-11769587094049.html,2026-01-28 08:59:35,"Union Budget 2026 Picks: As the Union Budget for FY2026–27 approaches, market participants are bracing for a policy event that could once again influence sectoral leadership and medium-term market trends.
According to Axis Securities, India enters the budget season with relatively strong domestic fundamentals, even as global growth remains uneven amid geopolitical risks, tighter financial conditions and slowing external demand. The brokerage said investors are likely to focus on whether the government can sustain growth momentum without diluting its fiscal consolidation path.
In its pre-Budget note, Axis Securities identified a set of stocks it believes are well positioned to benefit from the government’s policy priorities.
Axis Securities also highlighted several thematic plays outside its core coverage universe, including GMDC as a rare-earths opportunity, BEL and MTAR in defence manufacturing, Amara Raja Energy in the EV ecosystem, CESE as a power reform play, and M&M Finance as a credit growth beneficiary. “Capital expenditure remains the cornerstone of India’s growth strategy,” the brokerage said, adding that sectors linked to infrastructure, manufacturing and energy transition are likely to remain in focus.
From a sectoral lens, Axis Securities expects autos and ancillaries to benefit from higher disposable incomes and stable tax structures, while banks and NBFCs could see improved credit demand from capex-led growth and MSME support measures. Infrastructure-linked sectors such as cement, metals, power and construction remain key beneficiaries, while healthcare, hospitality and telecom could gain from targeted policy support and structural tailwinds.
On the macro front, Axis Securities expects the government to allocate around₹12–13 trillion toward capital expenditure in the Union Budget 2026–27, implying a 10–15% year-on-year increase. Roads, railways, logistics infrastructure, defence indigenisation, urban infrastructure, housing, power transmission and renewable energy are likely to be key beneficiaries. The brokerage noted that sustained public capex has been instrumental in crowding in private investment and supporting earnings visibility across core sectors.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to remain a key anchor for markets. Axis Securities said the government is likely to target a fiscal deficit of around 4.2–4.4% of GDP for FY27, which would reinforce policy credibility and help contain bond yields and inflation expectations. Disinvestment and asset monetisation could play a larger role in non-tax revenue generation, with potential proceeds estimated at₹50,000–70,000 crore, although execution remains a monitorable.
Overall, Axis Securities said the Union Budget 2026–27 is likely to strike a balance between growth support and macro stability, a combination that could keep India favourably positioned within global equity allocations despite persistent external uncertainties.

On a standalone basis, BEL's revenue from operations stood at₹7,121.98 crore, reflecting a growth of 23.73% in the third quarter of FY 2025-26 compared to the revenue from operations of₹5,756.12 crore posted in the same period last year.
During the December quarter of FY 2025-26, PAT amounted to₹1,590.06 crore, representing a growth of 20.82% over₹1,316.06 crore recorded in the corresponding period of the previous year.
As of January 1, 2026, the company's order book was valued at₹73,015 crore, said the company in an exchange filing.
Profit before tax for the quarter totaled₹2,128 crore, up from₹1,744 crore in the same quarter last year, representing an approximate growth of 22%. The company's tax liability was₹558 crore, slightly lower than₹561 crore during the same period last year, benefitting from deferred tax adjustments.

According, Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree, BEL shares have delivered a decisive breakout from a 29-week cup and handle pattern at 422, triggered post results and backed by a sharp volume expansion of over 318 percent.
“The surge confirms fresh participation and improves trend strength across timeframes. Price acceptance near the pivot remains the key tell. If the stock manages a sustained close above 422, momentum is likely to extend toward the 475 to 490 zone, where prior supply may re-emerge,” said Jain.
Anshul advises that traders should anchor stops tightly around the pivot and look for follow-through volume to confirm continuation.

Over the past five sessions, Vedanta shares have gained a cumulative 10.5%.

livemint,markets,India–EU free trade agreement finalised. Can it accelerate an India-US trade deal?,"After nearly two decades of negotiations, the India-EU free trade agreement has been finalised, igniting speculation about a potential India-US trade deal. Experts debate whether this new agreement could influence US tariffs and trade negotiations.",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/indiaeu-free-trade-agreement-finalised-can-it-accelerate-an-india-us-trade-deal-11769154632124.html,2026-01-28 08:11:54,"India and the European Union (EU) have entered into a landmark free trade agreement that will further open India's markets to European goods.
The EU, which accounts for 25% of global GDP and 33% of global trade, is one of India's biggest trade partners. The India-EU trade deal is expected to further strengthen collaboration between the two major economies of the world across key policy areas such as trade, security, and defence.
While the deal is a significant positive development for the Indian economy and the stock market, investors' focus remains on the India-US trade deal front, as the US, according to reports, remains India's largest trade partner.
At first glance, the logic appears compelling that an India-EU FTA may nudge the US to finalise a long-stuck trade deal with India. Due to geopolitical and geoeconomic reasons, India remains a key strategic partner for the US.
Experts say that from a geopolitical standpoint, deeper trade ties with India remain important for the US. However, it is difficult to assume that India's trade deals with other major economies will put pressure on the US to accelerate a deal with New Delhi.
Some experts believe that the India-EU trade deal may prompt the US to reconsider its tariffs on India.
""With this new India-EU FTA after dragging for almost two decades, there are hopes that now the US will also be under some kind of compulsion to close a deal with New Delhi,"" said Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist and Executive Director, Anand Rathi Group.
A trade deal between India and the US remains stuck due to complex political, economic, and strategic issues.
The US has been pushing India on greater market access for agriculture, medical devices, digital trade rules, and labour and environmental standards. Moreover, lately, Trump has been harshly criticising India for buying Russian oil.
India, on the other hand, remains determined to safeguard its farmers and the agriculture sector from increased US imports. New Delhi has also been firmly reiterating that it will prioritise its national interests.
There have been several occasions over the last few months when both countries have signalled that a deal was imminent. However, despite multiple rounds of negotiations, a final India-US trade deal remains elusive.
""It is possible that Trump may be further infuriated by this India-EU deal, and he might put even more conditions on India,"" VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments, said.
India runs a sizeable trade surplus with Washington, and experts feel a bilateral trade deal would likely require New Delhi to offer meaningful concessions to narrow this trade imbalance.
With a deal with the EU, India has sent a signal that it is willing to move beyond a defensive trade policy and pursue comprehensive agreements.
However, a deal with the US may ultimately depend on how policies in both countries shift, evolving geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine war, and sectoral trade-offs.
""An India–US trade deal will depend more on New Delhi’s willingness to liberalise further and Washington’s readiness to compromise. India’s trade policy is becoming more outward-looking, which is a structural positive for long-term growth,"" said Vijayakumar.

The growth rate looks impressive partly because Q3FY25 profitability had suffered due to high input prices of tea, which were passed on in Q4FY25.
The volatility in the tea business has compelled Tata Consumer to stay focused on the performance of ‘growth’ businesses, which are essentially the branded segments in India other than tea and salt. They include Tata Sampann, Tata Soulfull, ready-to-drink (RTD) products (Tata Gluco+, Tata Copper+, Himalayan), Capital Foods (Ching’s Secret and Smith & Jones) and Organic India.
In Q3FY26, the growth businesses clocked the highest revenue increase in at least the past seven quarters, at 29%. This was largely volume-led growth across categories with Tata Sampann at 45% and RTD at 26% the notable ones.
The growth businesses have now achieved a quarterly run-rate of₹1,000 crore, though their profitability has not been disclosed separately. The company maintains the common cost overheads across all businesses makes it difficult to ascertain the Ebitda margin for each business.
However, the international Ebit margin fell by 167 bps to 12.3% as higher coffee prices hurt profitability. The company increased coffee prices in January to pass on the higher raw material costs, which should help in increasing the Ebit margin in Q4.
Investors must also see the valuation premium in the context of the former’s projected FY28 RoE at 10% versus the latter’s 26%.

Those awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks after the FOMC policy decision can tune in at 1:00 a.m. IST on Thursday, according to the official schedule.
Indian investors can also track Powell's speech on the above given official website links.
The FOMC has cut interest rates by 25 basis points in each of its past three meetings to prevent a cooling labour market from sliding into rising unemployment. The committee is now scheduled to meet this week to determine whether to reduce the federal funds rate further from its current range of 3.5%–3.75%.
Akshat Garg, Head - Research & Product at Choice Wealth, said that all signs point to the central bank hitting the pause button at this week's meeting, likely holding rates steady in the 3.50%–3.75% range.
He advised investors to think of this as a strategic ""wait-and-see"" moment rather than a change in direction. After aggressively cutting rates late last year, Chair Powell and his team need a moment to catch their breath and let those previous adjustments actually work their way through the plumbing of the economy, he said.
“A pause would align with the Fed’s data-dependent approach, allowing policymakers to evaluate whether recent disinflation is durable while monitoring signs of economic cooling. Inflation has eased from prior peaks but remains above the Fed’s 2% goal, reinforcing the need for caution against premature easing. Meanwhile, consumer spending remains steady, employment conditions are relatively tight, and financial markets have loosened modestly on expectations of future cuts,” said Seema Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities.
Srivastava further explained that this stance also tempers overly aggressive market bets on near-term cuts, keeping financial conditions aligned with policy objectives.
“Ultimately, a status-quo decision would reaffirm the Fed’s commitment to prudent monetary stewardship, emphasising that future moves will be guided by economic evidence rather than short-term sentiment or external pressures,” she added.
Furthermore, Garg expects Powell to signal that while the cutting cycle isn't dead, the Fed is perfectly comfortable sitting on its hands until the economic picture clears up.

livemint,markets,"As FPIs retreat ahead of Budget, can fiscal prudence revive market momentum?","For the fourth year running, FPIs are hitting the exit button ahead of the Union Budget. Yet, experts suggest this retreat is more about valuation arbitrage than a loss of faith in India’s long-term policy roadmap",https://www.livemint.com/market/union-budget-stock-market-fpis-selling-indian-equities-diis-vs-fpis-11769575071187.html,2026-01-28 07:39:33,"For four years now, January on Dalal Street has followed a predictable beat. Since 2023, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have used the pre-Budget weeks to retreat, seeking safety elsewhere. This year is no different.
FPIs have been on a selling spree since November, with sharp outflows of over₹36,000 crore so far in 2026 against₹78,027 crore a year ago.
In contrast, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) have transitioned from secondary players to the primary engines of the capital markets. Propelled by a steady stream of retail systematic investment plans (SIPs), they continue to pour liquidity into Indian equities. Does this suggest the Union Budget has become a mere domestic event?
“The Union Budget remains one of the most critical domestic events, not just for equity markets but for the entire financial ecosystem, as it sets the direction for long-term policy goals while outlining milestones for sustained economic growth,"" highlights Ajit Mishra, SVP, research, Religare Broking.
So what's in store for this year? With uneven global growth and moderating consumption, a tighter fiscal strategy is required, which naturally lowers market expectations. The government faces a strict fiscal glide path, leaving little room for a significant expansion in capital expenditure. “One of the key challenges for Budget 2026–27 is balancing capex-led growth with consumption support,"" notes an Axis Direct report
Mishra noted that with the government committed to maintaining the fiscal deficit around 4.3–4.4%, the scope for large populist measures is limited without risking fiscal credibility. “After several years of strong growth, infrastructure spending is expected to moderate as execution capacity peaks,"" he added.
Rather than headline-grabbing measures, experts believe the market is prioritising a Budget rooted in fiscal prudence and tax certainty, a strategy that would serve as a crucial buffer against an increasingly uncertain global backdrop.
The central government’s fiscal situation remained stretched in FY26, mainly due to weak tax collections. Tax collections remained muted during April-November 2025 and constituted 54.7% of FY26 budgeted estimates, which was significantly lower than the average value of 59.5% during the last four years, according to a JM Financial report.
This uncertainty has left investors on edge. They are unsure whether the upcoming Budget announcements could be the catalyst that breaks the current deadlock and sets the market's path for next month.
Historical data supports this hesitation, as Budget Day rallies have been rare; performance remains largely mixed with no consistent pattern of 'pre' or 'post' Budget gains. “The Budget could spark a recovery if meaningful tax relief is extended to investors—such as on STT or LTCG,"" Mishra said. “Or lead to consolidation if fiscal discipline remains the overriding priority.""
Given that the Budget is primarily aimed at setting long-term growth policies, it is unlikely to alter the short-term market trajectory. In the near term, the market will take cues from corporate earnings, trade developments, and the evolving geopolitical landscape, he added.

livemint,companies,"Deutsche Bank Deepens Emerging-Market Rebuild, Adds Two Traders","Deutsche Bank AG is deepening its push into emerging-market credit, adding two executives in New York as part of an expansion that began last year and included the high-profile poaching of a star trader from a rival.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/deutsche-bank-deepens-emerging-market-rebuild-adds-two-traders-11769626293185.html,2026-01-28 18:51:32,"(Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Bank AG is deepening its push into emerging-market credit, adding two executives in New York as part of an expansion that began last year and included the high-profile poaching of a star trader from a rival.
Thomas Fitzpatrick, who previously held senior trading roles at Mizuho Securities USA LLC and UBS, started in December, while former HSBC Securities trader Christopher Staudt was also hired by the German lender, according to people with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named discussing confidential information. Both will focus on Latin American corporate debt.
At least 13 people — spanning traders, salespeople and analysts — have joined Deutsche Bank’s desks in New York and London as the firm rebuilds its emerging-markets business, with a particular focus on Latin America. More hires are expected, potentially bringing the total to around 25, people familiar with the plan said.
The hiring spree is part of efforts led by executives including Chris Leonard, co-head of fixed income and currencies for the Americas, who pitched the expansion to senior management, the people said. A spokesperson for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
The bank had largely wound down its emerging-market credit desk in New York since around 2019, during a time when it was scaling back in several areas to focus on core businesses following a long period of scandals and losses. On Wednesday, Deutsche Bank was raided by German authorities as part of a money laundering probe. Public prosecutors are looking at past dealings by staff with firms linked to the now-sanctioned Russian financier Roman Abramovich, according to people familiar with the matter.
Deutsche Bank’s renewed commitment to emerging markets has come at a good time. The sector has been on a tear for months, spurred by President Donald Trump’s trade war and a rush to diversify and hedge exposure to the US, as well as growing confidence around many developing economies. Demand from yield-hungry investors drove one of the best years on record for emerging-market bond sales in 2025, a trend that has continued into this year.
The rebuilding efforts turned heads across Wall Street last year when the firm lured away star emerging-markets trader Justin Weinberg from Jefferies Financial Group Inc. — who took three colleagues with him. The defections roiled Jefferies, leading to the removal of one of the co-heads of emerging markets. The other departed.
After completing so-called garden-leave periods, Weinberg and his team spent weeks on the road last fall meeting clients and explaining the revamp. Now they’re starting to see a pickup in flows, according to people familiar, trading developing-world credits with large shops.

livemint,companies,ASML Investors Press Executives on Outlook Despite Bookings Beat,ASML Holding NV failed to satisfy investors with record orders in the fourth quarter as analysts continued to question whether the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker can sustain its artificial intelligence-fueled momentum.,https://www.livemint.com/companies/asml-investors-press-executives-on-outlook-despite-bookings-beat-11769625928929.html,2026-01-28 18:45:28,"(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV failed to satisfy investors with record orders in the fourth quarter as analysts continued to question whether the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker can sustain its artificial intelligence-fueled momentum.
The company’s bookings in the fourth quarter hit €13.2 billion ($15.8 billion) as AI infrastructure needs raised demand for its most sophisticated equipment, far exceeding the average analyst estimate of €6.85 billion, the Veldhoven, Netherlands-based company said in a statement on Wednesday. Even so, analysts raised concerns about the company’s ability to expand capacity and hit the high end of its revenue guidance for the year.
“The last three months have brought a lot of clarity” about what AI means for the semiconductor industry, Chief Executive Officer Christophe Fouquet said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Chief Financial Officer Roger Dassen separately said in a call with analysts that reaching the high end of the firm’s revenue range hinges on overcoming two constraints: customers’ ability to finish chipmaking plants in time to receive its tools and ASML’s own ability to ramp up capacity to meet soaring demand.
“We are ramping during the year to accommodate the demand,” Dassen said on the call. “But the demand is also a little bit dependent on the progress that our customers are making in terms of the completion of their” own chip plants during the year, he said.
ASML’s shares fell 1.9% to €1,194.40 in Amsterdam. The stock had earlier risen to a record high on the strong bookings beat. The company, Europe’s most valuable firm, also announced it plans about 1,700 job cuts, mostly in the Netherlands with some in the US, as it seeks to streamline the organization. That represents about 4% of the company’s workforce.
Net income in the fourth quarter was €2.84 billion, the company said, missing estimates.
During the call with analysts, Fouquet acknowledged the questions about the company’s manufacturing capacity for its top-end tools and how many extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography machines it will sell. “I sense some concern that we may be the bottleneck for the customer,” he said. “This is not the case, certainly not this year and again for next year.”
ASML is the only producer of cutting-edge lithography machines that are needed to make advanced semiconductors, and counts all the leading chip manufacturers as customers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. and Intel Corp. Its machinery is integral to producing the Nvidia Corp. AI accelerators that are the backbone for training and running AI models in data centers. The Dutch company’s bookings are one signal of chipmakers’ confidence in future AI demand.
The AI boom has continued into 2026, defying concerns about overinvestment and helping push ASML’s market value over $500 billion this month. Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are among the companies that are pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into building data centers, driving chipmakers to increase capacity and in turn stoking demand for ASML’s products. TSMC said this month it anticipates capital spending of more than $52 billion in 2026, much of which will be toward advanced manufacturing techniques.
More than half of last quarter’s bookings were for EUV, totaling €7.4 billion, ASML said. It recognized revenue in the period for two high NA EUV machines, a state-of-the-art tool that costs upwards of €350 million a piece.
Total net sales were €32.7 billion in 2025. Revenue is seen at between €34 billion and €39 billion this year, higher than previous guidance.
“ASML has knocked it out of the park when it comes to order numbers,” said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot. “Given the strength of the order book, we fully expect it to raise guidance throughout the year.”
The company also announced a new share buyback program of as much as €12 billion through the end of 2028. That amounts to about 2.5% of ASML’s current market capitalization.
ASML could achieve the top of its just-announced €34-€39 billion sales goal in 2026, based on its strong orders in 4Q25 and order backlog for chipmaking-tool systems of €38.8 billion. TSMC’s strong capex plan in 2026 will contribute to ASML’s sales growth, as will robust capex among DRAM suppliers such as SK Hynix, Samsung and Micron. — BI analysts Masahiro Wakasugi and Takumi Okano
Last week, Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang called the rush to build data centers that can power AI models the “largest infrastructure build-out in human history.” There is a need for “trillions of dollars” of additional investment in coming years, Huang said at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
China remained ASML’s biggest market in the fourth quarter, accounting for 36% of net system sales. The Chinese market is expected to fall to about 20% of revenue going forward, Dassen said in a call with reporters.
ASML has never been able to sell its EUV lithography machines to China due to US-led restrictions aimed at curbing the Asian nation’s progress in the semiconductor sector. It’s also restricted from selling its most advanced deep ultraviolet, or DUV, tools to the country. The machines it ships to China are eight generations behind the most sophisticated model. Still, Chinese chipmakers have been buying up older equipment to make mature chips.
ASML won’t report bookings in future quarterly results because the company argues the metric doesn’t accurately capture business momentum.

Bank of America also said it will allow eligible employees with children under the age of 18 to put money into Trump Accounts directly from their salary before tax is deducted, according to a memo sent to employees, Bloomberg reported separately.
Meanwhile, JPMorgan announced that the investment banking firm also granted a special award of $1,000 to eligible employees globally this year. The amount, which was deposited into their 401(k) accounts, was specifically rewarded to those workers who are earning less than $80,000 in total annual cash compensation.
US President Donald Trump introduced the accounts as part of his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in which the government will offer a one-time amount of $1,000 each to children born between the start of 2025 and the end of 2028.
It is expected to be rolled out on 4 July this year, and credited to the investment accounts of children with a ​valid Social Security number. Supporters of the programme argue that starting investments at birth ‍can improve economic mobility and give future workers a stronger chance to climb the economic ‌ladder,Reuterssaid.
The program was partly the brainchild of hedge fund manager Brad Gerstner and is aimed at narrowing the US wealth gap by promoting long-term saving and investing from birth.

(ONGC) is eyeing collaboration with ExxonMobil to jointly bid for India’s hydrocarbon blocks in the tenth round of auctions under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy, according to a top executive.
Queries mailed to ExxonMobil on late Wednesday evening remained unanswered until press time.
Sinha told reporters that the upstream major will focus on exploration activities along the east coast, including the Mahanadi, Krishna-Godavari (KG) and Cauvery basins, and off the coast of the Andamans.
ONGC and RIL will pursue sharing of key resources required for offshore operations, which may include onshore and offshore processing facilities, drilling rigs, marine vessels, power, pipelines, logging and well services.
The agreement is expected to deliver cost optimization through shared use of high-value rigs, vessels, logistics and specialized subsea equipment. The company also said that it will enable faster mobilization and execution by improving access to the limiteddeepwater services available.
On Tuesday, Pankaj Kumar, director (production) of the state-run energy major, said the company has reached out to as many as 10 global energy players to participate in its tender for the role of technical services provider (TSP) to enhance production in its western offshore fields.

Excluding that one-time provision, profit rose by a third y-o-y to  ₹4,406 crore.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/lt-order-inflows-in-q3-surge-to-record-1-36-trillion-top-expectations-profit-revenue-11769611582487.html,2026-01-28 16:48:52,"Beating market expectations, Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) posted its highest order inflows for any quarter in October-December 2025, as a revival in domestic private sector capital expenditure, alongside continued strength in international orders drove a surge in new project awards.
India’s largest engineering and construction firm secured fresh orders worth₹1.36 trillion during the quarter, up 17% year-on-year (y-o-y), taking its total order book to a record₹7.33 trillion at the end of Q3—the first time it has crossed the₹7 trillion mark.
The market, which had expected about₹90,000-1,00,000 crore order booking, was taken by surprise, according to Amit Anwani, VP and lead analyst for capital goods, industrials and defence, at brokerage PL Capital. “This growth is led by strong domestic business growth, which augurs well for coming quarters,” said Anwani.
So far in fiscal year 2026 (FY26), the company has received orders worth₹3.46 trillion, and is in a comfortable position to exceed its guidance for 10% growth in annual order inflow, R. Shankar Raman, L&T’s whole-time director and chief financial officer, said during a post-earnings media call on Wednesday. The company had received new business worth₹3.57 trillion in FY25.
On the other hand, consolidated revenue during the quarter increased 10% y-o-y to₹71,450 crore, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) rose nearly a fifth to₹7,417 crore. Ebitda margin expanded 71 basis points to 10.4%.
Unlike order bookings, revenue and Ebitda were below market estimates of₹74,875 crore and₹7,659 crore, respectively, as per the consensus of four brokerages compiled byMint. The consensus profit estimate was₹4,346 crore.
For the first nine months of FY26, revenue was up 12% at₹2.03 trillion. The company has maintained its 15% revenue growth guidance for the fiscal.
The fresh order flow was led by the firm’s mainstay infrastructure segment, which received orders₹61,876 crore, over 25% higher than the same quarter last year. This was due to strong inflows from both domestic and international businesses, with the orders split 55:45 in favour of the overseas business.
About three-fifths of the domestic infrastructure orders were from the private sector, Shankar Raman said. These orders were from on-shore oil and gas business, the power sector, as well as orders for new factories, among other things, he said.
“Looking ahead, we remain optimistic that pro-growth momentum will be maintained in the ecosystem through sustained capital expenditure,” Subrahmanyan said in the statement. “We expect additional policy thrust to strengthen domestic manufacturing and fiscal incentives to support the deepening of India’s digital and AI ecosystem.”
The company’s prospect pipeline—open tenders for which the company would consider bidding—was at₹5.96 trillion at the end of the quarter. Earlier, Kuwait, one of the company's key overseas markets, scrapped $10 billion worth of oil and gas tenders, for many of which L&T had emerged as the lowest bidder. The middle eastern country cited a budget shortfall.
To be sure, this doesn’t count as lost business for L&T as these projects were not part of its order book yet, but it means that the prospects for the company have narrowed.
L&T’s stock gained a marginal 0.1% to close at₹3,793.65 on the BSE on Wednesday. The earnings were made public post trading hours.

In an interview toMinton the sidelines of India Energy Week 2026, Rahul Tandon, head of BPCL's gas business, said the global trading major Vitol was holding discussions with prospective buyers of clean fuels. Refueling at such facilities are largely carried out through term contracts.
""We are all geared up. It's just that now we are interacting with customers and making customers... global liners Maersk, Hapag and MSC, among others. Vitol is talking to the customers and arranging the customers,"" he said.
Queries mailed to Maersk, MSC, HAPAG and Adani Ports on Wednesday evening remained unanswered at the time of publishing.
BPCL is also looking at chartering a vessel to set up the facility, which would be India's first LNG bunkering facility, Tandon said. He added that the facility was in line with the government's vision to develop India as a maritime hub as it would provide a clean refueling option to ships across the Indian Ocean region. He noted that currently, the nearest LNG bunkering facility is in Singapore. Other facilities are in Europe, with Rotterdam providing the largest capacity.
Tandon was optimistic on demand, given that the shipping sector is moving towards cleaner fuels such as LNG and green methanol. ""These large ship containers have the capacity to take 5,000 to 10,000 cubic meters (of LNG). We are currently exploring for chartering either a 12, 000 or 18, 000 cubic meter vessel, he said.
Situated strategically near to the east-west international shipping corridor, the upcoming facility is expected to establish Vizhinjam as a major hub for low-carbon shipping across the Indian Ocean region.
The initiative was formalised in October 2025 through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Limited (AVPPL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) during India Maritime Week 2025 in Mumbai. The state-run refiner and oil marketing company have also signed an MoU for LNG bunkering and dual-fuel vessels at Cochin Port in Kerala.
""We been working on it for past one-and-a-half years, working closely with the DG shipping and department of explosives to make sure that the guidelines, SoPs, everything is in place. We' got the bunkering license about 2-3 months ago,"" Tandon said.
LNG has recently gained more attention as ship fuel not only in Europe but also in Asia and the US. Using LNG for ship reduces sulphur oxide emissions by 90% to 95%. It can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions up to 23% with modern engine technology, according to DNV, a global independent assurance and risk management provider.
In October, prime minister Narendra Modi said with a coastline exceeding 7,500 km and an expanding network of globally competitive ports, India was poised to become a major maritime hub, offering not only connectivity but value-added services, green shipping initiatives, and industry-friendly policy frameworks. He called on domestic and international investors to invest in India's maritime space.

“We’ve been working to strengthen our organisation by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy,” Galetti said.
The company was planning a second round of layoffs as part of its broader strategy of cutting nearly 30,000 corporate roles within the organisation, according to a report by Reuters.
Employees in Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and the People Experience and Technology HR units are likely to be impacted, the report said.
Amazon has announced that, despite these changes, it will keep hiring and investing in key strategic areas crucial for our future growth.
“We've been working to strengthen our organisation by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy. While many teams finalised their organisational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now,” the blogpost read.
The 30,000 jobs would represent a small fraction of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, making up nearly 10% of the corporate workforce. The majority of Amazon’s staff is based in fulfilment centres and warehouses.

To support the capex plan, the telecom operator is looking to raise₹25,000 crore in bank funding and₹10,000 crore in non-funded facilities. The company, however, is not seeking equity funding at this time.
The telecom operator’s current funding structure (bank funding and non-funded facilities) is adequate to manage the investment plan, and it may re-evaluate the situation two years down the line for fundraising via equity, Abhijit Kishore, chief executive officer of Vodafone Idea, said at an analyst meet in Mumbai.
The proposed investment of₹45,000 crore, combined with the₹18,000 crore spent over the past six quarters, would take the company’s total network investment to over₹60,000 crore over a four-and-a-half-year period, the company said at the analyst meet.
To be sure, in May 2024, Vodafone Idea had said it planned to incur capital expenditure of₹50,000-55,000 crore over the next three years. The company, however, has not been able to raise funding through bank debt to expedite the capex plan. Last month, the company announced that it raised₹3,300 crore through secured non-convertible debentures (NCDs).
“AGR overhang is behind us…I think to my mind it (relief from the government) is a definitive conclusive long-term solution with a very clear visibility on our cash flow,” Kishore said.
He said the capex will be used for network expansion. The telecom operator plans to achieve 4G parity with competitors across its 17 priority circles, which contribute over 99% of revenue, within 12 to 24 months. Simultaneously, it will expand 5G coverage across urban markets with populations of 20,000 or more over the next 12–30 months. The company will allocate about 70% of capex to radio access, with the remainder to transport and core network infrastructure.
“Through FWA (fixed wireless access), which is on the 5G, we would definitely want to get into the SOHO (small office home office) and the home space, (in) which we are not present right now. We are looking at some options and opportunities as far as getting an entry into a small office or home office is concerned,” Kishore said.
“The₹45,000 crore capex looks fantastic, but relative to the competition, the number looks underwhelming,” Sanjesh Jain, telecom analyst at ICICI Securities, told the management during the question-and-answer session.
In comparison, Bharti Airtel has been spending about₹30,000 crore in capex every year, Sunil Bharti Mittal, founder and chairman of Bharti Enterprises, said in a recent interaction with CNBC-TV18. “Capex has not come down. We are spending₹30,000 crore in capex every year. It will continue to be spent.” Mittal explained that investment requirements shift across technologies. If spending slows in 4G, it shifts to 5G, and as 5G deployment tapers, capital is redirected toward fibre, fixed wireless access (FWA), and data centres. “I would say a little more than (₹30,000 crore) than less than (₹30,000 crore) will be the order of magnitude (for capex),” Mittal said.
Comments from Vodafone Idea’s management have come at a time when the telecom operator has got a breather from the government on payment of its adjusted gross revenue dues. The Cabinet on 31 December decided to freeze the company's₹87,695 in AGR dues as of December-end.
“The AGR overhang meant funding was not available. Without funding, investments and deployments suffered. That hurt network experience, impacted brand perception and led to subscriber losses,” Kishore said, adding that the company will soon get past negative customer additions.
After the AGR dues freeze, the telecom company’s total outgo towards AGR payments over the next six years, from March 2026 to March 2031, would be₹744 crore, a maximum of₹124 crore per year. It will also have to pay₹100 crore annually over four years, from March 2032 to March 2035.
The government had approved a payment plan for the company to clear its frozen AGR dues over FY32-41. As per the Supreme Court orders in October and November, the government has also begun the exercise to reassess the company's AGR dues.
While the AGR dues are frozen, Vodafone Idea faces spectrum payment obligations of about₹49,000 crore over the next three years. The instalment would be approximately₹7,000 crore in the first year,₹15,000 crore in the second and around₹27,000 crore in the third. The company’s total deferred payment obligation (including interest accrued but not due) towards spectrum was at₹1.25 trillion as of 31 December.
Besides, Vodafone Idea’s outstanding bank debt (including accrued but unpaid interest) was₹4,424 crore as of December end. The company said the scheduled instalments, payable by December 2026, amount to₹1,126 crore, including interest.
When asked whether promoters will infuse more funds, Sushil Agarwal, chief financial officer of Aditya Birla Group, said, “As a promoter, we have stood by this company all throughout…Tomorrow, if there is need, promoters will not run away.” He added that the promoters have invested₹27,000 crore in Vodafone Idea in the last few years.
Analysts said Vodafone Idea would need tariff hikes to reach its 3x Ebitda target of about₹30,000 crore over the next three years. “Any pricing intervention is a call of a leader, not a call of a challenger. We have always maintained that the industry needs a price repair. We will wait for the leaders to take a call on that, and then we will evaluate,” Kishore said.
In comparison, market leader Reliance Jio has a different stance on tariff hike, which has ruled out any immediate increase, signalling confidence in organic growth in its average revenue per user (Arpu), driven by rising 5G usage.
Vodafone Idea has been losing subscribers. Data shared by the company suggests that over the last 6 years, it has been losing subscribers at a rate of 15 to 16 million customers per year. However, the pace of loss has declined over the last two years, the company said, adding that it is now 5.3 million.
During the quarter, the company lost 3.8 million subscribers, taking its subscriber base to 192.9 million as of the end of December. In the previous quarter, the company’s subscriber base was at 196.7 million. In the year-ago period, the subscriber base was at 199.8 million.
The company said the challenge is less about acquiring new customers (which is decent at around 30% in networked areas) and more about retention. It is hoped that deploying the committed₹45,000 crore in capex to fill coverage gaps will naturally address retention issues.
During the December quarter, the telecom operator reported a net loss of₹5,286 crore, compared to₹6,609 crore in the same period last year. In the previous quarter, the company reported a net loss of₹5,524 crore.
The narrower loss during the quarter was largely driven by exceptional items, including provision write-backs on remeasurement of settlement assets with its promoter Vodafone Group, amounting to₹1,228 crore. In the absence of the same, Vodafone Idea's losses would have expanded sequentially and narrowed marginally year-on-year.
The company’s revenue from operations increased 2% year-on-year and 1.15% quarter-on-quarter to₹11,323 crore, also surpassingBloomberg’sestimate of₹11,297 crore. A marginal improvement in revenue can be attributed to the company’s network expansion and increased data consumption on the network.
On Wednesday, shares of Vodafone Idea closed 2.3% higher at₹10.06 on the National Stock Exchange.

The company was reportedly planning a second round of layoffs as part of its broader strategy of cutting nearly 30,000 corporate roles within the organisation.
“Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That's not our plan,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said.
News around Amazon's global layoffs comes at a time when the Big Tech firm continues to have a robust number of job listings in India.
Data collated byMintresearch found that while Amazon had a total of 1,949 jobs across all verticals open as of 30 September 2025, the total open numbers saw a 4% decline to 1,869 jobs as of 31 December.
As of 28 January, Amazon has 1,846 jobs open in India, with about 120 new roles added across artificial intelligence, e-commerce, Amazon Web Services, Amazon Pay and other verticals over the past seven days itself.
Mintcould not immediately ascertain if the company's global layoffs will affect current jobs and pace of hiring at Amazon India as well.
A recentCNBCreport suggested that Amazon mistakenly sent a notice via an internal email to some of its employees acknowledging “organisational changes” at the company.
“Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of applied AI solutions at AWS, wrote in the email, cited in the news portal's report. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organisation and AWS for future success.”
According to aReutersreport, the notice appeared to have been sent prematurely to Amazon Web Services (AWS) employees, a day before the next round of Amazon layoffs.
Last year, Amazon's CEO said that the rising use of AI tools would lead to more automation of duties, resulting in corporate job losses.
Although 30,000 jobs is a big number, it comprises nearly 10% of Amazon's corporate workforce, with the majority of its workers in fulfilment centres and warehouses, aReutersreport mentioned.
According to the agency report, the tech giant has been investing in robotics at its warehouses to speed up packaging and deliveries for its e-commerce segment in an effort to reduce the reliance on human labour and cut costs.
Companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft hired many people during the global pandemic of 2020 amid the demand surge, and now are restructuring their corporate workforce.

Bansal also reiterated the need to ease bilateral agreements to allow foreign airlines to operate more flights to India – at least until Indian airlines build up sufficient capacity.
Bansal told reporters in October that international airlines are expected to join after the airport receives permits for night operations. Foreign carriers will get a one-year waiver on parking fees, which domestic carriers will not receive, Bansal said at the time.
Since 25 December 2025, there have been 23 daily departures from the airport. This is expected to increase to 34 daily departures starting in February, the operator said in a press statement in November.
The airport crossed 100,000 passengers within the first 19 days of commercial operations, according to the latest update. Navi Mumbai airport faces teething issues with regard to network connectivity. Lack of mobile network signals and patchy coverage have been reported at the newly inaugurated airport.
NMIAL is the eighth airport owned by Adani Airports Holding, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, which is the flagship company of the Ahmedabad based conglomerate.

livemint,companies,WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart hits back at Elon Musk over app 'not secure' remark amid Meta privacy lawsuit,"Meta has denied allegations that it reads users' private messages on WhatsApp, with WhatsApp head Will Cathcart calling them 'totally false'. Details here.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/whatsapp-chief-will-cathcart-hits-back-at-elon-musk-over-app-not-secure-remark-amid-meta-privacy-lawsuit-11769590405002.html,2026-01-28 10:33:22,"Meta has pushed back on allegations that it can secretly read users' private messages on WhatsApp, with the messaging platform's head, Will Cathcart, dismissing the claims as ‘totally false’.
Cathcart's remarks were directly aimed at billionaire Elon Musk's claims that WhatsApp is ‘not safe’, and that users should rather switch to X's messaging service as a safer alternative for communication.
“This is totally false. WhatsApp can’t read messages because the encryption keys are stored on your phone and we don’t have access to them,” Cathcart said in an X (formerly Twitter) post.
These sharp remarks from Meta and rival company executives come amid renewed scrutiny of message security on WhatsApp after an international group of plaintiffs sued Meta platforms on Monday. The lawsuit accused the company of making false privacy claims.
The complaint makes serious claims that Meta employees can gain access to any user messages through an internet system, which means they can bypass the encryption that WhatsApp has marketed as its core privacy feature for the past many years.
“This is a no-merit, headline-seeking lawsuit brought by the very same firm defending NSO after their spyware attacked journalists and government officials,” Cathcart wrote on X.
A spokesperson for Meta also responded to the allegations earlier, stating that the lawsuit was “frivolous”, along with announcing that the company “will pursue sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel,”Bloombergreported.
According to WhatsApp, its encrypted chats are enabled by default, with an in-app message stating that “only people in this chat can read, listen to, or share” the messages exchanged between two or more people.
Elon Musk, who owns rival company X, has had a longstanding rivalry with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, which has included business disagreements over data practices, AI and rockets.
The feud was sparked in September 2016 after a collaboration between the two billionaires did not go well, as Zuckerberg’s $200 million satellite exploded during a pre-launch test on one of Musk’s SpaceX rockets.
In his latest tweet on the Meta privacy row, Musk also questioned Signal, which is a privacy-focused app endorsed by whistleblowers like Edward Snowden. Snowden said in a tweet earlier that he can vouch for the Signal app, noting it is secure and that he uses the platform every day.
The lawsuit remains underway, with industry experts, legal analysts, and market watchers closely tracking its progress as they await further updates and clarity on the next stages of the case.

livemint,companies,How to fix Disney: A road map for the next CEO,Barron’s offers a four-step plan for Bob Iger’s successor.,https://www.livemint.com/companies/how-to-fix-disney-a-road-map-for-the-next-ceo-11769595962690.html,2026-01-28 10:30:34,"There has been plenty of drama at Walt Disney over the past decade. Since January 2016, the House of Mouse has released four Star Wars films, built a streaming platform, and overseen the departure and dramatic comeback of CEO Bob Iger.
But it has hardly been a fairy tale for investors. Disney shares were trading at about $110 on Tuesday—just 17% above where they were 10 years ago. Netflix and the S&P 500 are up 832% and 271%, respectively, over the same period.
Still, there’s reason for hope. Barron’s in December named the stock as a top pick for 2026, citing a cheap valuation for a company that controls elite entertainment assets and looks set for strong theme-park earnings growth.
There will also be a new CEO. Iger is set to step down at the end of 2026, with Disney expected to announce his successor within the next few weeks. Parks chief Josh D’Amaro and TV head Dana Walden are the leading candidates, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Disney didn’t respond to a request for comment about its CEO succession plans.
Whoever gets the gig faces a huge task in turning around a lost decade for the shares. Barron’s has drawn up a to-do list for Iger’s replacement.
1) Accelerate Streaming GrowthThis should be the new boss’ priority.

He rates the stock at Buy, with a $140 price target, implying upside of 27%.Disney looks to be moving in the right direction. MoffettNathanson estimates that the operating margin for the streaming division will climb to 11% from 7% over the fiscal year ending in September.Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said on an earnings call in November that the company plans to reach the double-digit milestone by increasing revenue, not cutting costs. “We’re certainly looking to gain margin in chunks, not in basis points, as we think beyond 2026 and into the future,"" he said.The goal looks achievable if the 2026 content slate (more on that later) is a hit.

livemint,companies,4700BC popcorn adds a dash of indulgence to Marico’s food portfolio,"Marico’s acquisition of premium popcorn brand 4700BC is aimed at adding indulgent snacking to its largely health-led foods portfolio, as the company targets 25% CAGR growth in the segment.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/4700bc-popcorn-marico-food-portfolio-gourmet-snacks-11769577753185.html,2026-01-28 09:42:29,"MUMBAI: 
     
      India’s snacking habits are moving from cinema halls to living rooms, and Marico wants a front-row seat.
As the FMCG major eyes a 25% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in its foods portfolio, its acquisition of premium popcorn brand 4700BC is designed to capture at-home indulgence without abandoning its health-led roots.
“One of our key learnings is that while consumers are willing to spend on healthier options, they are not willing to compromise on taste,"" Saugata Gupta, MD and CEO of Marico toldMint. “That’s where 4700BC becomes a great fit in our foods portfolio.""
Founded in 2012 as a premium packaged popcorn brand, 4700BC was acquired by multiplex operator PVR in 2015, which bought a 70% stake for₹5 crore. Marico this week acquired just over 93% of the brand for₹226.83 crore.
Marico’s foods portfolio grew 5% year-on-year in the December 2025 quarter, as some products were rationalized and Saffola edible oils saw a decline in volumes, remaining flat in value terms, the company said in its earnings release.
The company, however, reiterated that it is on track to grow the foods portfolio to eight times its FY20 size. In the December quarter, Marico reported 8% growth in volumes and 27% growth in consolidated revenue to₹3,537 crore, while profit after tax rose 12% year-on-year to₹447 crore.
Marico’s foods portfolio is largely anchored around health and wellness brands. These include Saffola, which sells oats, honey and soya chunks, and True Elements, a premium brand in which Marico first acquired a stake in 2022. It also owns Plix, acquired in 2023, which sells supplements such as apple cider vinegar.
“Plix strengthens our presence in nutraceuticals and also gives us a foothold in personal care,"" Gupta said. “Saffola and True Elements remain strong in wellness, but not in indulgence. And this was the gap we aimed to fill.""
He added that Marico wanted to participate in the emerging “gourmet but better-for-you"" space. “Our digital playbook focuses on building adjacencies where we have a right to win, and filling these spaces. With 4700 BC, we now have a place in the premium gourmet snacking category.""
Tata Consumer Products has also aggressively scaled via healthier brands like Soulfull and pan-Asian snacks under Ching’s Secret (Capital Foods). In contrast, HUL does not have a savoury snack play; it sells soups and packaged noodles under the Knorr brand, and has been selling ice-creams under Kwality Walls. It demerged this business in December last year.
In recent years, 4700BC has expanded its portfolio to include premium snacks such asmakhanaand nachos made in avocado oil. It has also tapped new sales channels, including business class offerings on airlines such as Etihad and Qatar Airways.
However, Gupta said most of the brand’s sales now come from online platforms, with only a small portion coming from PVR-Inox cinemas.
Marico will continue the brand’s sales arrangement in over 50 PVR-Inox theatres, Gupta added, while also expanding distribution through modern trade and general trade using Marico’s existing network.

The company also expects that the region will need nearly 45,000 pilots, 45,000 technicians, and 51,000 cabin crew over the next 20 years.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/boeing-says-indian-south-asian-airlines-will-need-3-300-new-aircraft-by-2044-amid-rising-air-travel-demand-11769589529658.html,2026-01-28 09:04:02,"“India and South Asia's passenger air traffic will rise an average of 7 per cent annually over the next 20 years, spurred by a growing middle class, economic growth and airport and connectivity investments,” said Boeing, cited in the agency report.
According to the agency report citing the aircraft manufacturer, narrow-body aircraft will account for nearly 90% of the projected deliveries at 2,875, while wide-body aircraft will be at 395.
Boeing's Managing Director of Commercial Marketing, Eurasia and Indian Subcontinent, Ashwin Naidu, said that India is a growth market and the country will add more planes.
The report also mentioned that the demand for air travel means airlines will need nearly 3,300 new aeroplanes by 2044.
“Accounting for growth and replacement, the Indian and South Asian region's fleet will grow from 795 to 2,925 airplanes in two decades, a nearly fourfold increase over that time,” the report mentioned.
As per the CMO, Indian and South Asian airlines are also expected to expand and diversify their long-haul networks as India grows as a key hub for international passenger and cargo traffic.
“The South Asia region's widebody fleet will more than triple by 2044 as carriers enable millions of Indian and South Asian passengers to travel to international markets including the Middle East, Europe and North America,” said Boeing in its report cited by the news agency.
The report also mentioned that the air cargo market will be boosted by high-tech manufacturing growth in India and the increasing role of e-commerce, as they increase the need for more freighter aeroplanes.
“The South Asia region's fleet of new and converted freighters is expected to grow five times its current size over the next two decades to support rising air cargo demand,” Boeing said.

livemint,companies,Adani Power Q3 preview: Bangladesh deal may weigh on earnings,Investors will closely watch Adani Power’s Q3 results amid uncertainty over its Bangladesh power deal.,https://www.livemint.com/companies/adani-power-q3-earnings-bangladesh-deal-impact-investor-outlook-11769583686492.html,2026-01-28 08:30:02,"MUMBAI: 
     
      Adani Power Ltd’s contrarian bet on coal-fired power plants—at a time when most private-sector peers shunned the dirty fuel amid environmental scrutiny—has ensured the firm will have a clear growth path over the coming decade, according to experts.
However, skittish investors who are paying a premium for this growth story, may see a short-term hurdle over uncertainty around the company’s lucrative power supply deal to Bangladesh.
As the company declares its earnings on Thursday, revenues are expected to grow marginally to₹13,848 crore, up from₹13,434 crore in the year-ago quarter, according to the consensus estimate of three analysts polled byBloomberg. Profit is expected to grow by 5% to₹3,075 crore, the analysts estimated.
The muted earnings growth estimate has been attributed to a similar growth in demand for thermal power during this period.
Here are the top things investors should look out for at the company’s Q3FY26 earnings:
Adani Power’s 1,600-megawatt ultra super-critical plant at Godda in Jharkhand supplies power exclusively to the Bangladesh grid. The transaction, which brings rich margins for the company, has come under scrutiny after an influential national review committee (NRC) in Bangladesh analyzed the country’s severely haemorrhaging power sector.
The NRC has concluded that the national power distributor was buying more electricity than the country needed, and that it was doing so at a high price from private players, especially Adani Power. It recommended renegotiations of these deals, which puts in jeopardy Adani’s 2017 deal with the now-ousted Sheikh Hasina government.
The company makes over₹8,300 crore a year in revenue and over₹4,800 crore in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) from the deal, as disclosed by its management in an analyst call on 1 May 2025. This translates to over 14% of the company’s FY25 revenue and nearly a fifth of its Ebitda that fiscal year, making the deal vital for the company.
“Cash flows from the 1.6-gigawatt Godda plant in Bangladesh remain exposed to payment delays, power purchase agreement (PPA) renegotiation risk, and legal uncertainty following scrutiny by the Bangladesh high court, despite recent clearance of past dues,"" analysts at brokerage JM Financial noted in a report on 2 January.
But the company has one trick up its sleeve—an imminent connection to the Indian grid. In the event the contract with the Bangladesh government falls through, the company has a backup plan to sell the power in India. However, it is not an ideal scenario, as power will sell at a much lower price in the spot market in India, as demonstrated above. Moreover, there are significant pending dues from the Bangladesh Power Development Board, which could further affect the company’s cash flows.
Adani Power is the most rapidly growing coal-based independent power producer in the country. It plans to ramp up its capacity from 18.2GW at present to 41.9GW by 2032. This will make it the largest thermal power producer in the country.
With the increasing share of variable-renewable power in India’s grid, the government is working to rapidly expand steady thermal power capacity to handle base loads. The country has charted the need for 80GW additional thermal power capacity by FY32, of which, Adani Power has already locked in 23.7GW, giving it a significant growth potential.
“Adani Power was the first one to see the indispensability of thermal power in India’s growth story, while many industry peers were scaling back on thermal due to the global shift toward renewables,"" the JM Financial analysts noted.
The company gradually built capacities and became the country's largest private-sector thermal power producer with over 18GW capacity through organic growth (10.8GW) and a string of acquisitions of stressed assets (7.3 GW).
Investors would keenly track updates and management outlook on this. “Adani Power is undertaking aggressive capacity expansion, exposing it to risks of time and cost overruns, funding pressure, and execution slippages, despite its strong track record and land availability,"" wrote the JM Financial analysts.

livemint,companies,Fleet constraints slow Air India Express’s Navi Mumbai expansion,"While IndiGo and Akasa have rolled out most of the routes they announced last year, Air India Express hasn't been able to achieve its goal. In September, it had said it would operate 20 daily departures, connecting 15 Indian cities in the initial phase of the new airport’s operations.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/air-india-express-navi-mumbai-flights-expansion-11769577937966.html,2026-01-28 08:20:08,"Hyderabad: Faced with fleet constraints, budget carrier Air India Express expects to expand connectivity from the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) to 15 other cities by the end of 2026, a target it had aimed to achieve in the early phase of the new airport's operations.
According to data compiled by Curium, the Tata Group-owned Air India Express currently connects Bengaluru and Delhi to Navi Mumbai International Airport, which began commercial operations on 25 December last year.
IndiGo operates flights from India's newest airport to 13 cities, while Akasa Air flies to four, according to data from Curium.
While IndiGo and Akasa have rolled out most of the routes they announced last year, Air India Express hasn't been able to achieve its stated goal. In September, it had said it would operate 20 daily departures or 40 air traffic movements from and to NMIA, connecting 15 Indian cities in the initial phase of the new airport’s operations. The airline had also said it intended to scale up to 55 daily departures by mid-2026, including up to 5 daily international flights from NMIA.
Singh cited fleet constraints that have limited the carrier’s planned connectivity expansion.
Air India Express’s fleet size is about 110. In November, Singh said that the airline would add 20-24 planes in 2026, which would translate to about 2 planes per month.
Singh, however, clarified that Air India Express’s fleet size at the end of 2026 would remain almost unchanged.
“However, fleet size will remain the same. Because there will be returns,"" Singh said.
Air India Express is refreshing its fleet with new aircraft, increasing the share of modern planes that deliver superior, more consistent customer experience. As part of this transition, aircraft at the end of their lease terms will be phased out, keeping the overall fleet size unchanged, a company spokesperson toldMint.
The previous induction of 51 aircraft was mostly white tails, which are fully constructed airplanes produced by manufacturers (like Boeing or Airbus) that do not have an immediate, contracted customer. These planes are frequently created when orders are cancelled, during production overruns
On 1 October 2024, Air India Express completed its merger with AIX Connect, previously known as AirAsia India. The Tata Group now operates two airline brands: Air India and the low-cost carrier Air India Express.

The Mumbai-based company, which has campuses in Navi Mumbai, Noida and GIFT City, had secured approvals to list its US parent entity following a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).
The company will now prioritize an India initial public offering (IPO) amid rising domestic investor appetite for digital infrastructure and AI-linked assets, said Sunil Gupta, chief executive officer of Yotta. He said Yotta retains the option to raise capital overseas later.
“Our current plan is to raise capital in India first. The structure allows us to keep the US option open, it’s a question of sequencing,"" Gupta said in an interview withMint. “If everything goes well, next financial year is when we could be coming to the market in India.""
“Indian investors are already factoring India risk when they invest. For overseas investors, India is still an external risk,"" he said. “Given the response we are seeing in India from family offices, high-net-worth individuals and funds, we believe we may be able to raise sufficient equity domestically to fund our near-term GPU, cloud and data centre expansion.""
Yotta’s parent company, Nidar Infrastructure, said it planned to list on the Nasdaq through a merger with Cartica Acquisition Corp, valuing the business at $2.75 billion pre-transaction, according to regulatory filings. The combined entity was expected to list under the tickers YTTA and YTTAW.
However, Nidar Infrastructure said in a 7 January filing that it had elected not to proceed with the business combination outlined in the Form F-4 registration statement. Gupta said the SPAC transaction is now off the table and that any future US listing would require a fresh process.
Gupta said an India-first listing would allow Yotta to build scale and valuation before tapping the overseas markets.
“Once we are listed in India, we can approach overseas markets with much higher strength,"" he said.
“India’s capital market investors are showing strong appetite for AI-adjacent public listings, particularly across AI software, data centres, cloud services and application-layer technology,"" said Shivam Bajaj, founder and chief executive officer of Avener Capital.
The current listed universe offers limited pure-play AI exposure, leaving investors with few direct avenues to participate in the theme, Bajaj said.
“For AI builders, a key question will be how public market investors ultimately value the business, whether as a data centre-led infrastructure platform with stable cash flows or as a strategic AI company with technology-driven upside,"" he added, pointing to a healthy pipeline of upcoming data centre IPOs.
Sify Infinit Spaces Ltd has received the market regulator’s approval for a₹3,700 crore IPO, while Hyderabad-based CtrlS Datacenters is exploring a public listing to fund its expansion to over 1 gigawatt of capacity within four years.
Gupta called for a sharp increase in government funding for the IndiaAI Mission in the upcoming FY27 budget.
Yotta’s revenue more than doubled to an estimated $49.2 million in FY24 from $22 million in FY23, while its net loss narrowed marginally to $52.8 million. The company has projected revenue of $156 million in FY25, alongside a deeper net loss of $113.4 million as it accelerates capital expenditure.
According to Mordor Intelligence, India’s data centre and AI infrastructure market is expected to grow from about $11.76 billion in early 2026 to $25.07 billion by 2031, driven by cloud adoption, data localization requirements and AI workloads.
At its flagship Panvel campus near Navi Mumbai, Yotta has expanded its land bank from an initial 20 acres to about 70 acres, enabling the development of up to 22 data centre buildings, Gupta said. He declined to disclose a completion timeline, saying construction will be driven by customer contracts and demand visibility.
“We won’t build blindly. The pace depends entirely on the deals we win,"" he said.
Once fully built, the Panvel campus alone will have power feasibility of up to 2 GW, supported by land, fibre and grid connectivity.
“Without AI, we were projecting around 3 GW by 2028-2030 overall. With AI demand, India could reach 6 to 7 GW in the same period.""
Yotta’s revenue mix has shifted sharply toward higher layers of the stack. Co-location now contributes about 20% of revenue, sovereign cloud and managed services account for roughly 30%, while GPU and AI services make up 40-50%.
To be sure, the economics vary significantly across layers. Building a traditional co-location facility typically requires $5-6 million per megawatt of IT load. Fully GPU-based AI infrastructure can require investments of up to $40 million per megawatt.
Despite strong demand, access to risk capital remains the biggest constraint for India’s AI infrastructure ecosystem, he added.

Fulcrum aims to enhance efficiency and accuracy, allowing brokers to focus on high-value tasks.&amp;nbsp;",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/insurtech-startup-fulcrum-raises-25-million-in-seed-series-a-funding-11769581895769.html,2026-01-28 06:49:23,"Fulcrum, the leading AI platform for insurance brokerages, on Wednesday, January 28, announced $25 million in combined seed and series A funding.
The company said the funding was led by CRV, with participation from several prominent insurance and tech angel investors, including South Park Commons and Foundation Capital.
The company, in a media release on Wednesday, said that it is helping insurance brokerages “modernise their day-to-day workflows with AI agents that handle coverage and claim analysis, proposal generation, client and carrier sales prep, policy checking, and certificate issuance.”
So far, critical servicing tasks in the sector have been handled by business process outsourcing (BPO) partners, which often require each policy to undergo multiple handoffs among BPO teams.
Fulcrum, co-founded by CEO Arjun Mangla and CTO Sambhav Anand, is attempting to address this issue.
According to the company, its AI agents handle everything from “coverage and claim analysis, proposal generation, policy checking, client and carrier sales prep, and certificate issuance — enabling brokerages to deliver faster, more accurate service without adding headcount or relying on costly BPO providers.”
“For too long, insurance brokerages have accepted a complex and outdated web of partners, paperwork, and legacy systems. We’re showing that it doesn’t have to be this way. Fulcrum is re-architecting the brokerage back office with AI that’s fast, precise, and deeply integrated into how teams actually work,"" said Arjun Mangla, Co-founder and CEO of Fulcrum.
Fulcrum claimed its customer base already includes nearly half of the top 50 U.S. insurance brokerages, reflecting rapid adoption among large, data-heavy firms that previously depended on offshore BPOs for policy checking and quality assurance.
“The amount of variation, minutiae, and data that brokerages deal with is enormous. Even the best heuristic software couldn’t manage this level of complexity at scale. With recent developments in AI, that’s finally changed. We’re able to rethink how the manual, repetitive parts of the job get done so brokers can focus on the high-value work they actually enjoy,"" said Sambhav Anand, Co-founder and CTO of Fulcrum.

Musk responded to the controversy by name-calling Khosla while pointing out that his partner is half Indian and that one of his sons is named after an Indian physicist.
Khosla responded to the post, alleging racism on the part of the X owner and claimed that Musk was not propagating “Make America Great Again” but instead “white America great again.”
Meanwhile, Musk once again claimed that Khosla had tried to stop the public from using a public beach near his house, an allegation he has also made in the past. The billionaire appears to be referring to Khosla’s multiple lawsuits over restricting public access to Martins Beach near his estate.
The two billionaires have a history of clashing on social media over various issues. During the 2024 US elections, Musk had urged Khosla to support Donald Trump. In response, Khosla said it was hard for him to support someone “with no values, lies, cheats, rapes, demeans women, hates immigrants like me.”
Khosla, who is among the first institutional backers of OpenAI, has also defended the ChatGPT maker against Musk’s lawsuits, stating that Musk suing OpenAI feels like “sour grapes.” Khosla added that Musk did not get in early enough in the AI race and did not stay committed, which is why he is now resorting to litigation.

livemint,companies,"Four years under Tata, Air India still in recovery mode. How does it stack up against IndiGo?","Air India has made progress towards a turnaround in the Tata Group fold. But it’s far from a breakout, and catastrophic setbacks have not helped.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/air-india-vs-indigo-air-india-express-tata-group-aviation-industry-india-11769512763547.html,2026-01-28 03:30:41,"On 27 January 2022, the government sold its beleaguered airline Air India to the Tata Group. Four years later, the airline is in better shape, on a path of consolidation, growth, and repair. Yet the pace of that turnaround, amid generally favourable industry conditions, has fallen short of management’s expectations. A key setback was the crash of an Air India international flight in Ahmedabad in June 2025.
But even without that tragedy, data shows that Air India and its low-cost subsidiary, Air India Express, have grown more slowly than their main rival, IndiGo, and are far from challenging its dominance.
India’s domestic aviation market has steadily expanded. The year the Tatas acquired Air India was still a recovery period after covid-related shutdowns, but 2023 saw about 152 million passengers on domestic flights, rising to roughly 161 million in 2024. Estimates for 2025 suggest 165-170 million passengers.
Air India Express has steadily gained, crossing a 10% passenger share for the first time in 2025. Air India’s domestic share, however, slipped after cutting frequencies on select routes following the June crash. IndiGo, meanwhile, faced operational challenges due to pilot shortages under new regulations.
A clearer long-term view comes from comparing market share between 2022 and 2024. Over this period, the Air India duo gained 4.2 percentage points, while market leader IndiGo added 5.9 points, on a larger base.
The international segment has seen similar trends. Passenger numbers rose from 28.4 million in 2023 to 32.7 million in 2024, with 2025 expected to reach around 36 million. Indian carriers’ combined market share now stands at roughly 46%.
In 2025, following its plane crash, Air India cut back capacity on some long-haul routes, resulting in a marked drop in its 2025 share. Here too, a truer comparison is between 2022 and 2024, where the Air India duo gained 1.2 percentage points in passenger share, while IndiGo gained 2 percentage points.
Distance is another variable in the international segment. Air India operates more wide-body aircraft, which travel longer distances and have a higher seating capacity. Thus, its share of passenger revenues is higher than its share of passengers. For example, among Indian airlines in 2024, Air India had a 35.9% share of passengers, but a 53.1% share of passenger-kilometre.
The June 2025 plane crash has been a setback for Air India. It is in the midst of a five-year-old, ambitious, and multi-pronged transformation titled Vihaan.ai, which began in September 2022. The significant pieces of this plan include buying new planes, retrofitting old ones, integrating multiple airlines, expanding to new routes, adding more operational staff, and investing more in other building blocks like training and maintenance.
Both Air India and Air India Express need new planes to expand and win passenger share, as well as to improve their fleet specs. At their current average age of 8.6-8.8 years, their fleets are among the oldest among Indian airlines.
Another area where Air India has had to catch up in a significant way is strength of pilots. Between March 2016 and March 2022, this count for Air India dropped from 1,411 to 1,116. For Air India Express, it inched up from 269 to 333.
Between March 2022 and March 2025, Air India’s pilot strength grew threefold and that of Air India Express sixfold. Together, as of March 2025, they were only 51 pilots short of IndiGo. On a per-plane basis, they were doing better than IndiGo, though the requirement for wide-bodied planes, which Air India operates more, is greater.
Pilot strength also gains importance in light of new regulations, which necessitate all airlines to have more pilots than they currently have.
But profitability remains elusive. In 2024-25, the two airlines reported a combined net loss of about₹9,700 crore. Setbacks like the crash don’t help the business, from both a reputational and financial standpoint.
Last week, Bloomberg reported the airline was looking at a net loss of about₹15,000 crore for 2025-26. Compare this with IndiGo, which reported a similar net profit in 2023-24 and 2024-25.
For airlines, the main cost is fuel, and crude oil prices have been favourable. Air India has capitalised on this window, but not to the extent it initially charted out.

This follows previous rejections for a full assembly plant, reflecting a strategic shift as the company aims to expand amid growing sales in the Indian market.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/byd-could-expand-india-operations-as-demand-begins-to-outstrip-supply-11769569908465.html,2026-01-28 03:14:49,"BYD Co. is weighing options to expand in India, including local assembly to meet surging demand for the Chinese automaker’s electric vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter.
The company is evaluating some form of local assembly in India and working on obtaining local safety and regulatory certifications for more models because of import quotas, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plans have not been publicly disclosed.
The discussions highlight both the opportunity and the regulatory hurdles BYD faces in one of the world’s fastest-growing auto markets. They also reflect a strategic shift for the Chinese carmaker, which is now doubling down in India, despite New Delhi’s pushback in the past to its investment proposal during a period of heightened scrutiny of Chinese firms. Ties between India and China have somewhat thawed since last year as both nations faced steep tariffs levied by the US.
A spokesperson for BYD did not respond to an email seeking comment on its India plans.
Diversifying beyond China has become increasingly important for BYD as growth slows at home amid reduced EV subsidies and intensifying competition. It’s aiming to increase deliveries to markets outside China by nearly 25% this year.
BYD’s India sales jumped about 88% last year to roughly 5,500 cars, straining its ability to operate under rules that cap imports of each fully built model at 2,500 units. That growth came despite import duties of up to 110% on fully built cars, driven by a price tag that’s relatively lower than Tesla’s. Using SKD assembly would slash tariffs to 30% from 70%.
The company sells the Atto 3 compact e-SUV and the eMax7 multipurpose vehicle in India — both approved for imports beyond the 2,500-car quota — along with the Sealion 7 and the Seal sedan.
The automaker has approached Indian auto sector regulators to flag how import limits could constrain growth. Most inventory in the December quarter has been sold out, the people said, unlike Tesla, which continues to struggle against the same tariff barriers.
Despite a tentative thaw between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that led to the resumption of direct flights, policy support remains inconsistent.
Some BYD executives, including engineers and senior managers, have been visiting India since last year. But senior BYD executives who had planned visits last year have since delayed their travel, the people said, without giving more details.

The Japanese conglomerate, which is already one of the largest backers of the ChatGPT-maker, is adding to its stake in the company, people familiar with the matter told WSJ.
According to a separate report by Reuters quoting people with knowledge of the development, SoftBank is in deliberations to commit more capital toward the fast-growing startup.
The maximum amount SoftBank is considering is $30 billion, Reuters and WSJ reported quoting people familiar with the matter.
As per Reuters, the people cautioned that the discussions are fluid and the amount of funding could change. SoftBank’s shares rose 5.8% in Tokyo Wednesday.
According to that report, the investment round could value the company to as much as $830 billion if OpenAI succeeds in raising the funds.
SoftBank sold its stake in Nvidia Corp. and recently hit pause on talks to buy out US data centre operator Switch Inc.
The Tokyo-based company had amassed an 11% stake in OpenAI, injecting $22.5 billion just last month.
SoftBank has sharply increased its bets in AI in recent months. Over the past year, the Tokyo-based company has bought US chip designer Ampere Computing LLC for $6.5 billion and announced a $5.4 billion acquisition of ABB Ltd.’s robotics unit. To finance some of that cost, SoftBank has sold down its T-Mobile US Inc. shares, unloaded its entire Nvidia stake and expanded a margin loan using its Arm shares.
SoftBank’s investments in AI, along with the sharp drop in the value of Arm shares at the end of last year, are heaping pressure on its creditworthiness, S&P Global Ratings warned earlier this month.
Despite being early to invest in AI technologies, SoftBank has largely missed out on a global rush to build the semiconductors, server racks and other hardware to support machine learning.

The size of the cuts to be announced on Wednesday remained unclear. The full 30,000 jobs flagged in October would represent a small portion of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of the company's corporate workforce.
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs were meant to reduce management layers and bureaucracy inside the company.

Mizuho analysts led by David Bellinger said developing a larger fulfillment network could help Amazon push its market share into the mid-single digit range over the next two to three years from an estimated 3% in the category now. But the analysts also note that for the 12 months ended in June 2025, grocery rival Kroger had about 8.5% market share of grocery spending, Costco had about 8.4%, and Publix had 4.1%.
Mizuho sees a limited impact from Amazon’s move on Costco, which caters to a different kind of shopper who buys in bulk. Costco’s warehouse format is less dependent on online grocery purchases, the analysts said.
For Amazon to truly go up against Walmart’s 20% share, “we see something larger and more disruptive as necessary,"" the analysts said in a research note.
Some of its strategy shift is already in motion. Amazon is testing new retail formats, including a supercenter concept in suburban Chicago that will offer groceries, household products, and general merchandise, an idea that Mizuho said was very much focused at Walmart.
Amazon operated about 60 Amazon Fresh stores and about 15 Amazon Go locations, Mizuho said.
The renewed focus on online-driven delivery “is a heavy lift and massive structural limitation vs. the 4,000+ Walmart store locations,"" Mizuho said.
Amazon said shoppers will still be able to buy produce, dairy, meat, baked goods, and frozen foods along with millions of everyday household items, electronics, and other Amazon.com products, “all delivered within hours."" It said sales of perishable groceries through its same-day delivery operation have grown 40-times since January 2025, and that fresh groceries now make up nine of the top 10 most-ordered items in markets where perishables are available for same-day delivery.
Five of the new Whole Foods locations will be smaller-format Whole Foods Market Daily Shops, with prepared meals, coffee, and everyday items. Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017 and has expanded it to more than 550 locations.
Amazon said the “Just Walk Out"" technology it developed at its Amazon Go locations, allowing them to center on an automated grab-and-go format, has been “transformative."" It operates the technology in 360 third-party locations including hospitals and sports arenas.
It is expanding that technology internally to breakrooms at more than 40 Amazon fulfillment centers in North America, “helping employees maximize break time,"" with more planned for this year.

livemint,companies,Looming pregnant-worker rule changes poised to curb accommodations,USA-EEOC-PREGNANT WORKERS (PIX):Looming pregnant-worker rule changes poised to curb accommodations,https://www.livemint.com/companies/looming-pregnant-worker-rule-changes-poised-to-curb-accommodations-11769540669558.html,2026-01-27 19:04:29,"WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Nearly three months pregnant, Kennisha just needed to sit down. As assistant manager at a Sonic fast-food outlet on the outskirts of Dayton, Ohio, she sat on the only chair available to employees to ease her nausea, according to a complaint filed on Monday with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.
Sonic allegedly denied her accommodation request around Thanksgiving to occasionally sit on the one chair other employees used for smoke breaks. She quit and started work elsewhere, with a few months left in her pregnancy.
""It does feel good to have a new job, but it's still in the back of my mind now,"" said Kennisha, who asked to be identified by her first name only due to fear of retaliation.
COMMISSION CHAIR MAY NARROW RULE The 2022 law requires employers to reasonably accommodate pregnant workers under EEOC regulations. But those rules may dramatically change under Republican EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who said in 2024 the regulations were written too broadly. Now, as chair since November and with a Republican majority on the commission, she has already begun a top-down makeover of the agency to reflect ""a conservative view of civil rights,"" she told Reuters exclusively in December.
The final rules were written broadly to include as many scenarios as possible, experts and lawyers say. Any narrowing of the rules may expose pregnant workers to discrimination or deny them financial remedies in court, they said.
Lucas said in 2024 the rules erroneously included anything that ""relates to any aspect of the female reproductive system,"" which likely refers to abortions and in vitro fertilization, experts said. Those protections are almost certainly on the chopping block, but pregnancy accommodation is an open question, they said.
""The EEOC continues to prioritize and litigate pregnancy discrimination and harassment cases,"" an EEOC spokesperson said in a statement. The agency has not yet issued its 2026 regulatory agenda, a list of priorities agencies publish annually, but workplace lawyers expect changes soon. In January, the agency pared other policies in line with Lucas' conservative vision. About 2,700 pregnancy-related complaints were filed with the agency in fiscal year 2024, according to the most-recent data available.
Even if a case merits review under stricter rules, cases like Kennisha’s could be overlooked because of Lucas’ priorities to shift the EEOC’s focus toward issues long-championed by conservatives, such as claims of discrimination against white men, said Inimai Chettiar, president of legal and advocacy group A Better Balance, which represents Kennisha.
""We do have some concerns on how rigorously the EEOC is going to be investigating these types of violations,"" said Chettiar.
The rules cover a range of pregnancy-related physical and mental conditions. Employers can deny requests if they can show the accommodations would cause significant difficulty or expense.
""Efforts to weaken the PWFA’s meaningful worker protections, which have been shown to reduce miscarriage rates by nearly 10 percent, are misguided,"" said Democratic EEOC Commissioner Kalpana Kotagal, in a statement to Reuters. ""We should be standing up for women and families, not weakening their civil rights."" After doctors for Willamina Barclay, now 38, classified her March 2025 pregnancy as ""high-risk"" following a miscarriage, supervisors at her Amazon warehouse in Rochester, New York, denied her requests to work lower-stress tasks, she said in an interview and in an EEOC complaint.
In June, Barclay said she experienced severe abdominal pain after lifting heavy objects. Eventually, she was allegedly wheeled away in a wheelchair in front of Amazon human resources staff and supervisors to a hospital.
Amazon ultimately fired Barclay because she overused unpaid time off in violation of internal policies.
“We strive to provide a safe and supportive environment for everyone,"" said Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel in a statement. ""We’ll keep listening to our teams and investigating any concerns they raise, and if we find that we got something wrong, we work hard to make it right.”
Although the EEOC marked her case as possible for mediation, her lawyer said Barclay has to wait. Amazon is still deciding whether to meet and the agency may be considering an investigation and potential litigation in court — while also narrowing rules that could hurt her case.
""When you get fired, your bills don't stop, your kids don't stop, your babies don't stop, your family at home don't stop,"" she said in an interview. (Reporting by David Hood-Nuño Editing by Kat Stafford and Rod Nickel)

Last year, UPS started on a plan to reduce dependency on its largest customer, Amazon, and focus on higher-profit areas such as healthcare customers.
Chief Financial Officer Brian Dykes said during the company's conference call on Tuesday that the job cuts will be made through a voluntary buyout offer for full-time drivers and through attrition.
“This is a tactical move,” he said during a call with analysts. “We did something similar last year in order to help us to right-size the position levels and the network infrastructure with the new volume and delivery levels.""
UPS is also looking to close 24 buildings in the first half of the year and is evaluating additional buildings to close later in the year, he added.
CEO Carol Tome said during the conference call that by the end of 2025 UPS had reduced Amazon’s volume in its network by approximately 1 million pieces per day.
“We’re in the final six months of our Amazon accelerated glide down plan, and for the full year, 2026, we intend to glide down another million pieces per day, while continuing to reconfigure our network,” Tome said.
UPS also said it was officially retiring its fleet of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo planes after a deadly crash in Louisville, Kentucky in November. The planes, about 9% of the UPS fleet, had been grounded.

livemint,companies,Disney Actress-Turned-CEO Raises $100 Million for Space Firm,"Northwood, a maker of critical ground infrastructure for space satellites, raised $100 million in a new funding round led jointly by Washington Harbour Partners and Andreessen Horowitz.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/disney-actress-turned-ceo-raises-100-million-for-space-firm-11769539234941.html,2026-01-27 18:40:34,"(Bloomberg) -- Northwood, a maker of critical ground infrastructure for space satellites, raised $100 million in a new funding round led jointly by Washington Harbour Partners and Andreessen Horowitz.
The money will be used to help Northwood expand manufacturing and production, supporting space missions that need to happen on tight timelines, the startup said Tuesday. The company declined to give its valuation.
Northwood, based in southern California, makes phased array antennas, mobile ground infrastructure that increases satellites’ connectivity to Earth. While there’s been a massive build-out of satellites for telecommunications, defense and climate monitoring, the equipment for controlling and communicating with them is aging and becoming obsolete.
Northwood was co-founded and is led by Chief Executive Officer Bridgit Mendler. She is a former Disney Channel actress and platinum singer-song writer.
“Northwood provides the only viable approach capable of scaling ground station capacity to match expected satellite proliferation with the pace and security required,” Mina Faltas, founder and CEO at Washington Harbour Partners, said in an email.
The latest round comes less than a year after Northwood raised $30 million in funding also co-led by Andreessen Horowitz. Additionally, the startup has secured a $49.8 million contract from the US Space Force in support of launches as well as recovering lost or tumbling satellites.
“At this point there has been a three-month turnaround time from kickoff of that contract to actually delivering links, live, in the field,” Mendler said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday.
Northwood, founded in 2022, isn’t the only company focusing on ground infrastructure. BlueHalo, for example, has a $1.4 billion deal with the US Space Force to upgrade decades-old gear with their own defense-focused, steerable, phased array antennas.
Mendler said Northwood has spoken with Elon Musk’s SpaceX and other private space industry players about supporting their satellite networks.
“We have seen significant interest from commercial as well as government use cases,” Mendler said. “The ambition and challenge for space continues to grow.”

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vembu compared recent time's Big Tech companies to the historical East India Company, praising Europe’s awakening to the risks of foreign tech dominance, while also taunting at the irony.
Vembu’s remarks were in response to another post that highlighted France's decision to phase out US-based platforms. The homegrown platform, known as Visio, will be fully implemented in government agencies by 2027. Visio will handle conferencing with data hosted on French provider Outscale, and transcripts or subtitles managed by local firms.
Commenting on the development, Vembu wrote, “The very definition of a “sovereign nation” should now include technology sovereignty.”
“Big Tech now is the New East India company and Europeans are now waking up to it. History seems to rhyme with irony (sic),” the former Zoho CEO said in the X post.
Vembu compares Big Tech to East India Company, suggesting that modern tech giants exercise control over markets through dependencies on data and infrastructure, similar to how the British and French once controlled India and other colonies, though he did not say it outright.
Vembu’s post went viral, prmpting strong reactions from users and industry observers alike. Many users have urged him to accelerate the development and rollout of Zoho’s own privacy-focused tools.
Replying to these queries, Vembu said, “We are updating Arattai weekly. We will make a big push once we reach a certain level of feature compatibility and differentiation.” He added that achieving full tech sovereignty could take at least 5-15 years, citing complex technologies like EUV machines for semiconductors as examples.
Another user said, “In the 21st century, sovereignty isn’t just borders and armies — it’s data, platforms, and standards. Europe relying entirely on foreign Big Tech was always a strategic risk. Tech colonialism looks different, but the power dynamics are familiar. History really does rhyme.”

(ONGC) has reached out to as many as 10 global energy players to participate in its tender for the role of technical services provider (TSP) to enhance production in its western offshore fields, Pankaj Kumar, director (production) at ONGC, said to mediapersons on the sidelines of India Energy Week.
The companies approached include UK-headquartered Shell, bp plc, French major TotalEnergies, and US oil and gas giants ExxonMobil and Chevron.
The plan to bring in TSP for other fields comes at a time when the oil and gas production has largely been muted.
“We are now in the market for another TSP covering the Western Offshore, excluding Mumbai high field. The tender has been floated, and we have personally communicated with the CEOs of 10 major E&P (exploration and production) operators, including Shell, bp, Chevron, Exxon, TotalEnergies among others,"" Kumar said.
Bassein, Heera & Neelam fields and Panna-Mukta fields are key fields on the western offshore.
Queries emailed to Shell, bp, Chevron, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies on Tuesday late evening remained unanswered till press time.
According to the company, bp aims to increase oil production by 44% and gas production by 89%, leading to $15 billion of incremental revenue in 10 years.
Under the revival plan, ONGC and bp have split Mumbai High into six hubs for faster, optimized redevelopment. In the first phase, ONGC has already committed $400 million in capital expenditure. Under phase 2 of the Mumbai High field redevelopment, both companies have targeted 100 new wells in FY28 and FY29.
The company’s board has approved a development scheme to produce 12 mt of oil and 13.5 BCM of gas in the next few years.
The UK-headquartered energy giant would work in close collaboration with ONGC to stabilize the field’s current production decline and restore it to a robust growth trajectory. In August 2025, Arun Kumar Singh, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of ONGC said that study is currently underway for the planned enhanced oil recovery (EOR).
The standalone crude oil production during Q2 FY26 and H1 FY26 was 4.630 mt and 9.314 mt respectively, registering a growth of 1.2% over corresponding periods of FY25.
“On the gas production front also, ONGC has been able to arrest the degrowth. The decline, which was 0.35% in Q1FY26 over Q1FY25 has been brought down to 0.04% in Q2FY26 over Q2FY25,"" it had said in a statement.
Through measures including enhanced oil recovery, the state-run company aims to save a total of₹9,300 crore by FY27 through a number of cost-optimization measures planned by the company. The cost reduction would account for about 15% of the planned operational and capital expenditure cost of₹62,000 crore during the period, the director (production) had said in October.
The company has set up a dedicated cost council in the wake of subdued oil prices and a projection of crude trading tepid around $60 per barrel in the next two fiscals. Offshore resource optimization, increasing drilling, efficiency, logistics route optimization, inventory reduction and increasing fuel efficiency are the government-owned company’s key cost reduction initiatives.

India targets 3-nm chip production by 2032 and plans to boost funding and market access for startups under the DLI scheme.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/after-scl-mohali-tata-dholera-plant-to-help-startups-build-prototype-chips-ashwini-vaishnaw-fab-11769517648451.html,2026-01-27 14:33:26,"After the state-owned Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL) in Mohali, Tata Electronics’ upcoming semiconductor plant in Dholera will provide fabrication support to chip startups for design tape-outs, Union electronics and information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Tuesday.
Tape-out is the stage when a chip’s final design is sent to a semiconductor fabrication facility (fab), which then prepares it and produces the first physical prototype chips for testing.
This step is crucial, as many Indian startups have to currently rely on overseas facilities such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and US-based GlobalFoundries to get even limited samples of chips before actual production can start. This process is costly and also hampers Indian startups’ ability to carry out failure analysis, testing, and identify manufacturing or assembly challenges firsthand.
“The second facility, which will be used for taping-out, will be Tata’s Dholera fab. So the Dholera fab - 28 nanometer (nm) to 90 nm and SCL’s 180 nm. In a sense, close to 75-80% (of the kind of) chips which are manufactured in the world. That entire ecosystem we will be able to build in our country within the next 2-3 years,” Vaishnaw said at an industry event in New Delhi.
Currently, the SCL Mohali facility is being used to support chip-design startups and academia with tape-outs. However, it operates on an outdated 180-nm technology, which limits work on more advanced projects. In November, the government announced a plan to modernise the facility over three years at an investment of₹4,500 crore.
A government official said on the condition of anonymity that tape-outs of chip designs of academia are largely done at SCL on a multi-project wafer (MPW) basis. A few startups that have reached the stage of tape-outs are usually doing it at TSMC, for which they are getting incentives under the DLI scheme.
An MPW is a shared semiconductor wafer where multiple chip designs from different companies are fabricated together. It is a cost-effective way to manufacture prototype chips by sharing a wafer with multiple designs.
“Tata’s Dholera plant for tape-outs will certainly support the startup ecosystem building products in 28 nm and 40 nm technology. The price points for tape-outs, however, should not be higher than the global rates. Then it will be beneficial,” said Arumugam Govindswamy, managing director of MBit Wireless, a fabless semiconductor company in cellular internet of things (IoT) technology.
According to Govindswamy, the key ask from the government for the next phase of the chip design scheme is higher funding for tape-outs and mass production, besides better market access for selling products.
Separately, Vaishnaw said the government aims to make high-tech small chips of 3-nm nodes by 2032 that are used in products like modern smartphones, and computers. The plan is further to go to 2 nm.
""The level of 2032 is to reach 3 nanometer chips manufacturing and design. Design, of course, we are doing even today. But manufacturing, we should reach 3 nanometer,"" the minister said, adding that in the coming years, 50% of all the semiconductor design work in the world will be done in India.
“As we go into 2029, we will have a major capability of manufacturing and designing the chips which are required practically in 70-75% of all applications in our country,"" the minister said.
During the meeting, a few startups urged the government to improve market access for their chip products and increase funding support, as they are entering the mass production phase after tape-out, which entails significant costs.

Tariffs on pharmaceutical exports from Europe to India will drop to zero from 11% for almost all products. This will improve access for Indian patients to novel drugs from Europe and reduce input costs for specialized raw material imported from Europe, industry executives said.
Europe’s pharma exports to India amounted to €1.1 billion in 2024, according to a fact sheet released by the European Commission.
“The expected removal of EU tariffs of up to 11% on pharmaceuticals will enhance trade and support greater access to innovative medicines for Indian patients,"" Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said in a statement.
“In the short term, we anticipate a mild price reduction of 10-20%, but the real impact will unfold over the next 2-3 years, with prices potentially dropping by 40-70% once local manufacturing scales up, biosimilars enter the market and patent expiries align,"" said Saurav Ojha, co-founder and director of Gurugram-based Iberia Pharmaceuticals. “This shift is particularly critical in the context of weight-loss drugs in the GLP-1 class such as semaglutide and tirzepatide.
India imports drugs in the key therapy areas of oncology, biologics and monoclonal antibodies, insulin analogues and GLP-1 agonists as well as mRNA and viral vector vaccines from Europe.
“While OPPI is awaiting the release of the full Agreement, it has gone through Memo on EU-India Free Trade Agreement Chapter by Chapter Summary released by the European Commission and is encouraged that the summary states that the FTA provides a high level of protection and enforcement of IP (intellectual property) rights, in line with Indian and EU IP laws and also covers protection of trade secrets and undisclosed information,"" Anil Matai, director general of the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), which represents research-based global pharmaceutical companies in India, said in a statement.
Europe is India’s second-largest pharma export market, with sales of $5.8 billion in FY25. India accounts for 2.2 percent of the EU’s total pharma imports, highlighting the considerable headroom for growth, according to an Emkay Global Services report dated 24 January.
While Indian pharmaceutical products already face zero duty entry into the EU, the deal is expected to widen access, especially for small and medium enterprises.
“Reduced tariffs and smoother market entry will directly enhance their (MSMEs) ability to scale exports, invest in compliance and integrate into European supply chains,"" said Namit Joshi, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil).
“Indian companies continue to face significant non-tariff barriers in the EU, with approval timelines often extending to 2-3 years, delaying commercialization; registration fees can reach as high as €300,000, creating a material barrier,"" Emkay said in its report.
Details on how the trade deal will impact regulatory processes are awaited but streamlining them is expected to have the most benefits for Indian exporters.
While there was an EU push for stricter intellectual property measures like data exclusivity, which can delay the entry of generic drugs, the deal reinforces intellectual property protections provided under the TRIPS agreement and affirms the Doha Declaration under which governments can override patents if needed.
Tariffs on European medical equipment exports to India have also been slashed to zero from 27.5% for 90% of the products. Domestic medical equipment makers, who have sought further interventions to strengthen local manufacturing, which is very import-heavy, are cautious.
“The India-EU FTA must ensure a level playing field for India’s medical device manufacturers,"" Rajiv Nath, forum coordinator of industry body AiMed, told
Mint, adding that the agreement needs to have “fair regulatory alignment"" and “safeguards against predatory imports,"" especially from third-world countries. The industry body is awaiting the fine print on the deal, he said.

Details here.&amp;nbsp;",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tiktoker-khaby-lame-sells-part-of-step-distinctive-to-rich-sparkle-for-975-million-11769515133527.html,2026-01-27 13:43:04,"According to data fromBloomberg, Lame is selling a stake of his company, Step Distinctive Ltd., to Hong Kong-based firm Rich Sparkle.
The company plans to grow the 25-year-old creator's influence by pursuing brand collaborations and launching co-branded products across categories such as beauty, fragrance and apparel.
The agreement marks a strategic shift in how global creators monetise their influence, moving beyond traditional brand sponsorships and one-off advertising deals.
The transaction, which values Lame's company at about $975 million, involves the partial acquisition of his business and the formation of a long-term commercial partnership with the Nasdaq-listed Rich Sparkle Holdings Ltd.
The multi-million-dollar deal gives the financial services firm exclusive global rights for the next 36 months to manage and monetise Lame's online presence.
This means the company will handle how his brand is used across platforms, effectively turning him from a traditional influencer into an “equity-backed creator,” according to the company's statement.
Before bringing Lame on board, Rich Sparkle mainly focused on financial printing and corporate services, catering primarily to listed companies and institutional clients in Hong Kong.
Following the announcement, Rich Sparkle's shares surged sharply and are currently trading 18.84% higher at $63.01 on the Nasdaq.
The stock has delivered a staggering return of 188.11% over the past month, and around 142% in the last six months. Over the past year, Rich Sparkle has emerged as a multibagger for investors, rallying by more than 1,690%, according to data from the US stock exchange.
Khaby Lame, an Italian-Senegalese national, has around 160 million followers on TikTok, whereas Charli d’Amelio has 156 million, ranking her second-highest on the platform.
Lame rose to fame during the COVID-19 pandemic by creating wordless videos simplifying everyday life hacks. Since then, he has built a global fan following of 360 million people across TikTok and Instagram, according to the statement.
