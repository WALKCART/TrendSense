So far this month, silver has gained a massive 62%, after closing 2025 with a whopping 170% gain.
The US Dollar Index, which measures the currency against six major peers, rose 0.3% to 96.216, but remained near four-year lows. The currency crashed 1.28% to reach a four-year low in Tuesday's session after US President Trump said he was not concerned about the currency’s recent decline, adding that it had not fallen too much.
The dollar’s fall was also driven by Trump’s comments that he will soon announce his pick to serve as head of the Fed and his prediction that interest rates would decline once the new chair takes over.
Gold, which does not yield interest, typically performs well when interest rates are low. In addition, growing speculation over a potential joint US-Japan currency intervention to support the yen weighed further on the dollar.
The world’s reserve currency fell over 9% in 2025, marking its steepest annual decline since 2017, with losses further extending into early 2026, falling another 2.07% so far.
The Fed voted to lower the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point at each of these gatherings, bringing rates to a range between 3.50% and 3.75%.
However, investors will closely track cues about the timing of future cuts. The recent rate cuts announced by the US Fed were backed by a cooling labour market. Analysts, however, expect solid GDP growth, relatively low unemployment, and stubborn inflation will lead Fed officials to adopt a wait-and-see approach.

In pre-market trade, three key benchmarks were trading higher. S&P 500 futures rose 0.17%, Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.79%, largely led by tech stocks, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell marginally by 0.02%,
The meeting also comes as the Fed faces sharp challenges from President Donald Trump's administration, sparking concerns that its independence from politics could be threatened.
Economists, however, expect policymakers to hold firm as they assess the effects of the three consecutive rate cuts that brought the benchmark lending rate to a range between 3.50% and 3.75%,AFPreported.
Financial markets generally expect the Fed to continue keeping rates unchanged until its June meeting, according to CME FedWatch.
The recent rate cuts announced by the US Fed were backed by a cooling labour market. However, analysts expect solid GDP growth, relatively low unemployment, and stubborn inflation will lead Fed officials to adopt a wait-and-see approach.
Trump has sharply escalated pressure on the Fed since returning to the White House a year ago, seeking to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations, while his administration launched an investigation into Chairman Jerome Powell.
In a rare rebuke this month, Powell slammed the threat of criminal charges against him—over the Fed's headquarters renovation—as a threat to central bank independence.
US Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran said on Tuesday he saw the need for a significant drop in interest rates in 2026, advocating for a larger decline than the central bank has so far signalled, according toAFP.
Miran was appointed by President Donald Trump last year for a term lasting until late January, as the US leader publicly criticised the Fed for not cutting rates more rapidly.
The Fed voted to lower the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point at each of these gatherings, bringing rates to a range between 3.50% and 3.75%. Miran voted for a larger half-percentage-point cut on each occasion.

The US President's remarks were weighed further on investor sentiment, keeping the greenback under pressure. At its core, the dollar's strength rests on confidence — in the stability of US policy, and in the currency's role as the world's safest and most liquid asset.
Traders are also closely watching the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, hoping for clues on the future path of interest rates, as uncertainty over the Trump administration's policies persists following its latest tariff threats, adding to volatility in currency markets.
These reports further led to speculation that the White House was prepared to let the dollar weaken further, and President Trump did not outrightly dismiss the speculation when asked on Tuesday if he was worried about the US currency's decline.
“No, I think it's great,” he told reporters in Iowa after the unit hit its weakest level against the euro in four-and-a-half years and a two-and-half-month low against the yen. “Look at the business we're doing. The dollar's doing great.”
He further added: “I want it to be — just seek its own level, which is the fair thing to do.”

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will consider various economic indicators, such as inflation trends and labour market conditions, before announcing interest rates. After the meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will make a statement and address the press conference.
For the first month of the year, the two-day FOMC meeting was scheduled for 27-28 January 2026. The policy statement will be issued at 2 pm ET on January 28.
In the last FOMC meeting, it was decided to cut its key benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, 10 December 2025.
The Fed decided to cut the interest rate to 3.50%-3.75%, marking a 25-basis-point rate cut on 10 December 2025, amid elevated US inflation and a weakening job market.
All eyes are now on the US Federal Reserve's FOMC and Chairman Jerome Powell, as the central bank will announce its policy decision.
The FOMC meeting is scheduled for January 27–28. The policy statement will be released at 2 pm ET on January 28, followed by a press conference with Powell.
Jerome Powell’s press conference address will live stream on the US Federal Reserve’s website: https://www.federalreserve.gov/.
His speech will also be broadcast live on the Federal Reserve’s official YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/federalreserve.
US Fed Meeting 2026 LIVE: US Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell in his address to the press after the December 2025 policy announcement said that the central bank is not looking to hike its key interest rates anytime soon amid the overall closer to neutral stance, in line with its dual mandate.
“I don't think that a rate hike is anybody's base as the next thing is anybody's base case at this point, I'm not hearing that. What you see is some people feel we should stop here and that we're at the right place and just wait,” said Powell during his press address.
US Fed Meeting 2026 LIVE: Nine out of the 12 federal open market committee (FOMC) members voted in favour of the US Fed's policy decision to cut the key interest rates.
One official out of the remaining three was seeking a 50 basis point rate cut, while the other two wanted to keep the interest rates unchanged at their previous levels.
The key benchmark interest rates were cut by 25 basis points to the range of 3.50% to 3.75% after the December 2025 policy outcome.
U.S. stocks rose in early trading on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 surpassing 7,000 for the first time ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and earnings announcement from major companies like Microsoft, Tesla, and Meta Platforms.
Trump has significantly increased pressure on the Fed since returning to the White House a year ago, primarily to cut rates, raising questions about the independence of the central bank.
The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady this time amid solid GDP growth, relatively low unemployment, and current inflation levels, which have given them reason to shift into a wait-and-see mode, AFP reported.
It is widely anticipated that the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged, despite President Donald Trump's urging for more cuts, AFP reported.
Gold, a safe-haven asset, generally performs well during times of low interest rates and increased uncertainty. It has risen by more than 20% since the beginning of the year, continuing the record gains seen last year.
Inflation remains persistently above the Fed’s 2% target, and decreasing interest rates might further raise prices for U.S. consumers while supporting economic growth. Traders expect the Fed to resume rate cuts later this year, AP reported.
On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said that he would soon announce his pick to replace Powell, whose term as chair ends in May, Reuters reported.
Gold prices rose above $5,300 per ounce on Wednesday for the first time, boosted by economic uncertainty and a weakening U.S. dollar, as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's policy decision amidst growing concerns about its independence, Reuters reported.
In India, the FOMC decision will be announced on Thursday, 29 January at 12:30 am (IST), an hour later than usual due to Daylight Saving Time in the US. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks after the FOMC policy decision will be streamed at 1:00 am (IST) on Thursday, as per the official schedule.
""It's really tariffs that are causing most of the inflation overshoot,"" Powell said after the December Fed meeting, reiterating his expectation that the tariff impact on inflation is likely to be a ""one-time price increase.""
This week’s meeting is the Fed’s first in 2026, a year marked by major transitions. A new chair is expected after Powell’s term concludes in May amid growing political pressure.
As Jerome Powell's tenure as Fed Chair ends soon, Trump was questioned on whether he would remain at the US central bank as its governor for another two years.
“We live with the cards you’re dealt,” he said. “If that happens, his life won’t be very, very happy, I don’t think, by doing it. I think he wants to get out. He has not done a good job,"" Trump told CNBC.
At the October FOMC meeting, the US Federal Reserve decided to cut the key interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 3.75% to 4.00%, for the second time in the calendar year, amid elevated inflation and the US government shutdown.
After the December policy announcement, Trump said the rate cut could be “at least” twice as large as what was delivered and added that he wants the next Fed chair to be someone “honest” about interest rates.
At the December meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank will either maintain or cut interest rates at the next Fed meeting next year, as the Fed adopts a wait-and-see approach based on forthcoming economic data.
Jerome Powell’s press conference address will be live-streamed on the US Federal Reserve’s website: https://www.federalreserve.gov/.
The speech will also be broadcast live on the Federal Reserve’s official YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/federalreserve.
Akshat Garg, Head, Research & Product, Choice Wealth, said, “Inflation is generally behaving—hovering near 2.7%—but it isn't completely vanquished, and the labour market is cooling down without falling off a cliff, so there is simply no economic emergency requiring immediate action right now. Plus, amidst all the noise about political pressure, holding steady is a quiet power move that reasserts the Fed's independence. Expect them to signal that while the cutting cycle isn't dead, they are perfectly comfortable sitting on their hands until the economic picture clears up, likely eyeing the summer for their next move.”
Akshat Garg, Head, Research & Product, Choice Wealth, said, ""If you’re watching the Federal Reserve this week hoping for another quick rate cut, you might want to adjust your expectations. All signs point to the central bank hitting the pause button at this week's meeting, likely holding rates steady in the 3.50%–3.75% range. Think of this as a strategic ""wait-and-see"" moment rather than a change in direction. After aggressively cutting rates late last year, Chair Powell and his team need a moment to catch their breath and let those previous adjustments actually work their way through the plumbing of the economy.""
The Fed decided to cut the interest rate to 3.50% to 3.75%, marking a 25 basis point rate cut on 10 December 2025, amid elevated US inflation and a weakening job market.
The FOMC has reduced interest rates by 25 basis points at each of its last three meetings to prevent a cooling labour market from slipping into rising unemployment.
Market experts anticipate that the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates steady after the two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Meanwhile, media reports indicate that the central bank is facing political pressure from the Trump administration to cut rates.
In India, the FOMC decision will be announced on Thursday, 29 January at 12:30 am (IST), an hour later than usual due to Daylight Saving Time in the US. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks after the FOMC policy decision will be streamed at 1:00 am (IST) on Thursday, as per the official schedule.

In response, banks have steadily reduced fixed deposit rates. Currently, most large banks offer interest rates of 6.50%-7.00% on fixed deposits with tenures ranging from one to five years.
The Floating Rate Savings Bond, 2020 (Taxable) is a bond issued by the Central Government, with a floating interest rate linked to the National Savings Certificate (NSC) interest rate. It currently pays an interest rate of 8.05% p.a., and has the highest safety as it is issued by the Central Government. In short, it is referred to as FRSB, 2020(T). The bond’s tenure is seven years.
Any individual who is resident in India can apply for the bond. The minimum investment amount is₹1,000 and in multiples thereof. There is no maximum limit on the amount an individual can invest in the bonds.
The FRSB, 2020(T) interest rate is linked/pegged to the prevailing interest rate on the National Savings Certificate (NSC). The bond interest rate has a spread of (+) 35 basis points over the respective NSC interest rate. Currently, the interest rate payable on NSC is 7.70% p.a. (Jan to Mar 2025). Hence, the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is 8.05% p.a. (NSC interest rate 7.70% + 0.35% spread).
The interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is reset half-yearly on every 1st January and 1st July, based on the prevailing NSC interest rate on 1st January and 1st July, with a spread of (+) 35 basis points. As the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is subject to change on a half-yearly basis, based on the prevailing NSC interest rate, it is a floating interest rate product.
As and when the NSC interest rate is revised upwards, the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is revised upwards. Similarly, as and when the NSC interest rate is revised downwards, the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is revised downwards. As mentioned earlier, the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) is reset on 1st January and 1st July every year.
The interest on the FRSB, 2020(T) is paid at half-yearly intervals on 1st January and 1st July. For example, the interest amount for the period 1st January to 30th June is paid on 1st July. Similarly, the interest amount for the period 1st July to 31st December is paid on 1st January. There is no option to pay interest on a monthly, quarterly, yearly, or cumulative basis.
The half-yearly interest amount is credited to the bondholder’s bank account. The interest amount payment is subject to Tax Deduction at Source (TDS). The tax will not be deducted if the bondholder has made a declaration of tax exemption.
The interest earned on the bond is taxable. The interest amount is added to the individual’s income and taxed as per the individual’s tax slab.
An individual can apply for the FRSB, 2020(T) by submitting the duly filled application form online or in physical format at the authorised branches of:
The application must be submitted along with the payment. The payment can be made by cheque, draft, cash (up to Rs. 20,000), or any electronic mode acceptable to the bank. The bonds are issued to the bondholder in electronic format and are credited to the investor’s Bond Ledger Account (BLA). The bondholder will be issued a certificate of holding as proof of subscription.
The bondholder can nominate one or more persons as nominees by submitting Form C. A new nomination can be made, or an existing nomination can be cancelled by submitting Form D.
The FRSB, 2020(T), is not tradable in the secondary market. They are not eligible as collateral for availing loans from banks, financial institutions, and NBFCs. The bonds cannot be transferred, except to the nominee(s) / legal heir(s), in the event of the bondholder’s death.
The bonds are repayable on completion of the seven-year tenure from the date of issue. Premature encashment is allowed only for individuals aged 60 years and above, subject to certain conditions. On maturity, the redemption amount is credited to the bondholder’s bank account.
As mentioned earlier, most big banks are currently paying interest rates of 6.50% to 7.00% on fixed deposits with a tenure of 1 to 5 years. In the last one year, the RBI has reduced the Repo Rate by 125 basis points, from 6.50% (Jan 2025) to 5.25% (Dec 2025).
Following the RBI’s repo rate cuts, banks have also cut interest rates on their fixed deposits. Compared to the current interest rates of 6.50% to 7.00% on bank fixed deposits, the FRSB, 2020(T) offers a better interest rate of 8.05%. Based on interest rate comparison, the FRSB, 2020(T) comes out as a better investment product.
Also, if we look at the history of the NSC interest rates, the Government has held the NSC interest rates steady at 7.70% for the last three years (from Apr 2023 to Mar 2026). However, there is no guarantee that the Government will not cut interest rates in future.
You need to bear in mind that the FRSB, 2020(T) is a floating interest rate product. If the Government decides to cut the interest rates on the NSC in future, the interest rate on the FRSB, 2020(T) will also move lower. Also, the investment tenure of the FRSB, 2020(T) is seven years with low liquidity. An investor must consider these factors when deciding whether they should invest in the FRSB, 2020(T).

livemint,markets,"Budget 2026: Growth to stay in focus, but tax relief unlikely","As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to unveil Budget 2026, expectations are set for a significant increase in defence spending and continued public investment to bolster economic growth. However, tax relief appears unlikely amid revenue constraints and global uncertainties.&amp;nbsp;",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/budget-2026-growth-to-stay-in-focus-but-tax-relief-unlikely-11769598568455.html,2026-01-28 11:17:19,"Finance Minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting her record ninth consecutive Budget on February 1st 2026, in the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions in a VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) world.
Despite Trump tariffs, the Indian economy has done well and is poised to clock a GDP growth of 7.4% in FY26.
The average annual GDP growth during FY22 to FY26, factoring in the estimated 7.4% GDP growth for FY26, is an impressive 8.1%, assisted, of course, by the low base of the Covid year FY20-21. Inflation, the fiscal deficit, and the current account deficit are under control.
The fact that India has achieved this impressive growth while maintaining financial stability enhances the quality of its growth.
Even though the US-India trade deal is still hanging fire, the mega India–EU trade deal has come as a shot in the arm for the economy.
While the macros paint a robust picture, the micros are struggling. The impressive 24% CAGR in corporate earnings from FY21 to FY24 suddenly took a turn for the worse, dipping to 5% in FY25, pushing market valuations to elevated levels.
The AI trade, which dominated global stock markets in 2025, and the massive FII selling of $18 billion made India a huge underperformer in 2025.
There is a clamour for tax relief from investors. There is a view that tax reliefs are needed to bring FIIs back to the Indian market. Can the FM provide tax relief?
The year 2025 was a year of bold reforms. Budget 2025 raised the income tax exemption limit to₹12 lakhs, GST rates were cut and rationalised in September 2025, and four new labour codes- consolidating existing 29 labour laws- were implemented in November.
The RBI gave a big push to growth by cutting interest rates four times in 2025 by an aggregate of 1.25%. These fiscal and monetary stimuli have succeeded in pushing growth to an estimated 7.4% in FY26.
However, the low inflation rate has dragged the nominal growth rate down to an estimated 8.2% in FY26 against the Budget estimates of 10.1%.
The government is likely to face a revenue shortfall of around₹3 lakh crore in FY26. In this context of revenue constraints, it would be unrealistic to expect significant tax reliefs.
The income tax relief provided last year by raising the exemption limit to₹12 lakhs was much better than expected.
It is important to understand that India’s per capita income is around₹2,40,000. The exemption limit of₹12 lakhs means that even if a person earns five times the per capita income, she need not pay tax.
This is fair taxation, and therefore, it would be unrealistic to expect further relief in income tax. Corporate tax, too, is fair, and changes are unlikely.
The long-term capital gains (LTCGs) tax, reintroduced in 2018, was rationalised in the 2025 Budget by fixing the rate at 12.5%, thereby making the tax uniform across all asset classes like equity, equity-oriented mutual funds, gold and real estate.
A change in this tax rate is unlikely within a year. Exemption of FIIs from LTCGs, like in many countries, would be a huge positive for markets, but this is unlikely since it requires the abolition of the LTCGs tax.
However, there is scope for raising the tax-exemption limit for LTCGs from the present 1.25 lakhs to a higher level.
Fiscal consolidation has been a major success of the NDA government. The fiscal deficit has been brought down from 9.2% in FY21 to 4.5% in FY25.
The target for FY27 is likely to be 4.3% in FY27. From FY27 onwards, the government will be changing the matrix of fiscal discipline by moving from the present fiscal deficit to GDP ratio to debt to GDP ratio.
The FM is expected to target 55.5% debt to GDP with a commitment to bring it down to 50% by 2030.
The Budget will be carefully watched for the expenditure priorities. In the context of ‘Operation Sindoor’ and global geopolitical tensions, the defence outlay is likely to be increased by more than 20%.
From the market perspective, this will again put defence stocks in the limelight. In the context of languishing private capex, the FM will continue increasing public capex, even under revenue constraints.
This will be positive for infra stocks. The focus of the Budget will be growth, not tax relief.
Given the volatile global geopolitical context, the continuing 50% US tariffs on India, and the elusive US-India trade agreement, the FM has to do a fine balancing act to sustain high economic growth by increasing expenditure wherever required, even while maintaining fiscal discipline.
The FM has proved through her previous Budgets that she has the economic acumen and political savvy to deliver a fine balancing act. Let’s keep our fingers crossed.

(ONGC) is eyeing collaboration with ExxonMobil to jointly bid for India’s hydrocarbon blocks in the tenth round of auctions under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy, according to a top executive.
Queries mailed to ExxonMobil on late Wednesday evening remained unanswered until press time.
Sinha told reporters that the upstream major will focus on exploration activities along the east coast, including the Mahanadi, Krishna-Godavari (KG) and Cauvery basins, and off the coast of the Andamans.
ONGC and RIL will pursue sharing of key resources required for offshore operations, which may include onshore and offshore processing facilities, drilling rigs, marine vessels, power, pipelines, logging and well services.
The agreement is expected to deliver cost optimization through shared use of high-value rigs, vessels, logistics and specialized subsea equipment. The company also said that it will enable faster mobilization and execution by improving access to the limiteddeepwater services available.
On Tuesday, Pankaj Kumar, director (production) of the state-run energy major, said the company has reached out to as many as 10 global energy players to participate in its tender for the role of technical services provider (TSP) to enhance production in its western offshore fields.

Excluding that one-time provision, profit rose by a third y-o-y to  ₹4,406 crore.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/lt-order-inflows-in-q3-surge-to-record-1-36-trillion-top-expectations-profit-revenue-11769611582487.html,2026-01-28 16:48:52,"Beating market expectations, Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) posted its highest order inflows for any quarter in October-December 2025, as a revival in domestic private sector capital expenditure, alongside continued strength in international orders drove a surge in new project awards.
India’s largest engineering and construction firm secured fresh orders worth₹1.36 trillion during the quarter, up 17% year-on-year (y-o-y), taking its total order book to a record₹7.33 trillion at the end of Q3—the first time it has crossed the₹7 trillion mark.
The market, which had expected about₹90,000-1,00,000 crore order booking, was taken by surprise, according to Amit Anwani, VP and lead analyst for capital goods, industrials and defence, at brokerage PL Capital. “This growth is led by strong domestic business growth, which augurs well for coming quarters,” said Anwani.
So far in fiscal year 2026 (FY26), the company has received orders worth₹3.46 trillion, and is in a comfortable position to exceed its guidance for 10% growth in annual order inflow, R. Shankar Raman, L&T’s whole-time director and chief financial officer, said during a post-earnings media call on Wednesday. The company had received new business worth₹3.57 trillion in FY25.
On the other hand, consolidated revenue during the quarter increased 10% y-o-y to₹71,450 crore, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) rose nearly a fifth to₹7,417 crore. Ebitda margin expanded 71 basis points to 10.4%.
Unlike order bookings, revenue and Ebitda were below market estimates of₹74,875 crore and₹7,659 crore, respectively, as per the consensus of four brokerages compiled byMint. The consensus profit estimate was₹4,346 crore.
For the first nine months of FY26, revenue was up 12% at₹2.03 trillion. The company has maintained its 15% revenue growth guidance for the fiscal.
The fresh order flow was led by the firm’s mainstay infrastructure segment, which received orders₹61,876 crore, over 25% higher than the same quarter last year. This was due to strong inflows from both domestic and international businesses, with the orders split 55:45 in favour of the overseas business.
About three-fifths of the domestic infrastructure orders were from the private sector, Shankar Raman said. These orders were from on-shore oil and gas business, the power sector, as well as orders for new factories, among other things, he said.
“Looking ahead, we remain optimistic that pro-growth momentum will be maintained in the ecosystem through sustained capital expenditure,” Subrahmanyan said in the statement. “We expect additional policy thrust to strengthen domestic manufacturing and fiscal incentives to support the deepening of India’s digital and AI ecosystem.”
The company’s prospect pipeline—open tenders for which the company would consider bidding—was at₹5.96 trillion at the end of the quarter. Earlier, Kuwait, one of the company's key overseas markets, scrapped $10 billion worth of oil and gas tenders, for many of which L&T had emerged as the lowest bidder. The middle eastern country cited a budget shortfall.
To be sure, this doesn’t count as lost business for L&T as these projects were not part of its order book yet, but it means that the prospects for the company have narrowed.
L&T’s stock gained a marginal 0.1% to close at₹3,793.65 on the BSE on Wednesday. The earnings were made public post trading hours.

In an interview toMinton the sidelines of India Energy Week 2026, Rahul Tandon, head of BPCL's gas business, said the global trading major Vitol was holding discussions with prospective buyers of clean fuels. Refueling at such facilities are largely carried out through term contracts.
""We are all geared up. It's just that now we are interacting with customers and making customers... global liners Maersk, Hapag and MSC, among others. Vitol is talking to the customers and arranging the customers,"" he said.
Queries mailed to Maersk, MSC, HAPAG and Adani Ports on Wednesday evening remained unanswered at the time of publishing.
BPCL is also looking at chartering a vessel to set up the facility, which would be India's first LNG bunkering facility, Tandon said. He added that the facility was in line with the government's vision to develop India as a maritime hub as it would provide a clean refueling option to ships across the Indian Ocean region. He noted that currently, the nearest LNG bunkering facility is in Singapore. Other facilities are in Europe, with Rotterdam providing the largest capacity.
Tandon was optimistic on demand, given that the shipping sector is moving towards cleaner fuels such as LNG and green methanol. ""These large ship containers have the capacity to take 5,000 to 10,000 cubic meters (of LNG). We are currently exploring for chartering either a 12, 000 or 18, 000 cubic meter vessel, he said.
Situated strategically near to the east-west international shipping corridor, the upcoming facility is expected to establish Vizhinjam as a major hub for low-carbon shipping across the Indian Ocean region.
The initiative was formalised in October 2025 through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Limited (AVPPL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) during India Maritime Week 2025 in Mumbai. The state-run refiner and oil marketing company have also signed an MoU for LNG bunkering and dual-fuel vessels at Cochin Port in Kerala.
""We been working on it for past one-and-a-half years, working closely with the DG shipping and department of explosives to make sure that the guidelines, SoPs, everything is in place. We' got the bunkering license about 2-3 months ago,"" Tandon said.
LNG has recently gained more attention as ship fuel not only in Europe but also in Asia and the US. Using LNG for ship reduces sulphur oxide emissions by 90% to 95%. It can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions up to 23% with modern engine technology, according to DNV, a global independent assurance and risk management provider.
In October, prime minister Narendra Modi said with a coastline exceeding 7,500 km and an expanding network of globally competitive ports, India was poised to become a major maritime hub, offering not only connectivity but value-added services, green shipping initiatives, and industry-friendly policy frameworks. He called on domestic and international investors to invest in India's maritime space.

To support the capex plan, the telecom operator is looking to raise₹25,000 crore in bank funding and₹10,000 crore in non-funded facilities. The company, however, is not seeking equity funding at this time.
The telecom operator’s current funding structure (bank funding and non-funded facilities) is adequate to manage the investment plan, and it may re-evaluate the situation two years down the line for fundraising via equity, Abhijit Kishore, chief executive officer of Vodafone Idea, said at an analyst meet in Mumbai.
The proposed investment of₹45,000 crore, combined with the₹18,000 crore spent over the past six quarters, would take the company’s total network investment to over₹60,000 crore over a four-and-a-half-year period, the company said at the analyst meet.
To be sure, in May 2024, Vodafone Idea had said it planned to incur capital expenditure of₹50,000-55,000 crore over the next three years. The company, however, has not been able to raise funding through bank debt to expedite the capex plan. Last month, the company announced that it raised₹3,300 crore through secured non-convertible debentures (NCDs).
“AGR overhang is behind us…I think to my mind it (relief from the government) is a definitive conclusive long-term solution with a very clear visibility on our cash flow,” Kishore said.
He said the capex will be used for network expansion. The telecom operator plans to achieve 4G parity with competitors across its 17 priority circles, which contribute over 99% of revenue, within 12 to 24 months. Simultaneously, it will expand 5G coverage across urban markets with populations of 20,000 or more over the next 12–30 months. The company will allocate about 70% of capex to radio access, with the remainder to transport and core network infrastructure.
“Through FWA (fixed wireless access), which is on the 5G, we would definitely want to get into the SOHO (small office home office) and the home space, (in) which we are not present right now. We are looking at some options and opportunities as far as getting an entry into a small office or home office is concerned,” Kishore said.
“The₹45,000 crore capex looks fantastic, but relative to the competition, the number looks underwhelming,” Sanjesh Jain, telecom analyst at ICICI Securities, told the management during the question-and-answer session.
In comparison, Bharti Airtel has been spending about₹30,000 crore in capex every year, Sunil Bharti Mittal, founder and chairman of Bharti Enterprises, said in a recent interaction with CNBC-TV18. “Capex has not come down. We are spending₹30,000 crore in capex every year. It will continue to be spent.” Mittal explained that investment requirements shift across technologies. If spending slows in 4G, it shifts to 5G, and as 5G deployment tapers, capital is redirected toward fibre, fixed wireless access (FWA), and data centres. “I would say a little more than (₹30,000 crore) than less than (₹30,000 crore) will be the order of magnitude (for capex),” Mittal said.
Comments from Vodafone Idea’s management have come at a time when the telecom operator has got a breather from the government on payment of its adjusted gross revenue dues. The Cabinet on 31 December decided to freeze the company's₹87,695 in AGR dues as of December-end.
“The AGR overhang meant funding was not available. Without funding, investments and deployments suffered. That hurt network experience, impacted brand perception and led to subscriber losses,” Kishore said, adding that the company will soon get past negative customer additions.
After the AGR dues freeze, the telecom company’s total outgo towards AGR payments over the next six years, from March 2026 to March 2031, would be₹744 crore, a maximum of₹124 crore per year. It will also have to pay₹100 crore annually over four years, from March 2032 to March 2035.
The government had approved a payment plan for the company to clear its frozen AGR dues over FY32-41. As per the Supreme Court orders in October and November, the government has also begun the exercise to reassess the company's AGR dues.
While the AGR dues are frozen, Vodafone Idea faces spectrum payment obligations of about₹49,000 crore over the next three years. The instalment would be approximately₹7,000 crore in the first year,₹15,000 crore in the second and around₹27,000 crore in the third. The company’s total deferred payment obligation (including interest accrued but not due) towards spectrum was at₹1.25 trillion as of 31 December.
Besides, Vodafone Idea’s outstanding bank debt (including accrued but unpaid interest) was₹4,424 crore as of December end. The company said the scheduled instalments, payable by December 2026, amount to₹1,126 crore, including interest.
When asked whether promoters will infuse more funds, Sushil Agarwal, chief financial officer of Aditya Birla Group, said, “As a promoter, we have stood by this company all throughout…Tomorrow, if there is need, promoters will not run away.” He added that the promoters have invested₹27,000 crore in Vodafone Idea in the last few years.
Analysts said Vodafone Idea would need tariff hikes to reach its 3x Ebitda target of about₹30,000 crore over the next three years. “Any pricing intervention is a call of a leader, not a call of a challenger. We have always maintained that the industry needs a price repair. We will wait for the leaders to take a call on that, and then we will evaluate,” Kishore said.
In comparison, market leader Reliance Jio has a different stance on tariff hike, which has ruled out any immediate increase, signalling confidence in organic growth in its average revenue per user (Arpu), driven by rising 5G usage.
Vodafone Idea has been losing subscribers. Data shared by the company suggests that over the last 6 years, it has been losing subscribers at a rate of 15 to 16 million customers per year. However, the pace of loss has declined over the last two years, the company said, adding that it is now 5.3 million.
During the quarter, the company lost 3.8 million subscribers, taking its subscriber base to 192.9 million as of the end of December. In the previous quarter, the company’s subscriber base was at 196.7 million. In the year-ago period, the subscriber base was at 199.8 million.
The company said the challenge is less about acquiring new customers (which is decent at around 30% in networked areas) and more about retention. It is hoped that deploying the committed₹45,000 crore in capex to fill coverage gaps will naturally address retention issues.
During the December quarter, the telecom operator reported a net loss of₹5,286 crore, compared to₹6,609 crore in the same period last year. In the previous quarter, the company reported a net loss of₹5,524 crore.
The narrower loss during the quarter was largely driven by exceptional items, including provision write-backs on remeasurement of settlement assets with its promoter Vodafone Group, amounting to₹1,228 crore. In the absence of the same, Vodafone Idea's losses would have expanded sequentially and narrowed marginally year-on-year.
The company’s revenue from operations increased 2% year-on-year and 1.15% quarter-on-quarter to₹11,323 crore, also surpassingBloomberg’sestimate of₹11,297 crore. A marginal improvement in revenue can be attributed to the company’s network expansion and increased data consumption on the network.
On Wednesday, shares of Vodafone Idea closed 2.3% higher at₹10.06 on the National Stock Exchange.

The company was reportedly planning a second round of layoffs as part of its broader strategy of cutting nearly 30,000 corporate roles within the organisation.
“Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That's not our plan,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said.
News around Amazon's global layoffs comes at a time when the Big Tech firm continues to have a robust number of job listings in India.
Data collated byMintresearch found that while Amazon had a total of 1,949 jobs across all verticals open as of 30 September 2025, the total open numbers saw a 4% decline to 1,869 jobs as of 31 December.
As of 28 January, Amazon has 1,846 jobs open in India, with about 120 new roles added across artificial intelligence, e-commerce, Amazon Web Services, Amazon Pay and other verticals over the past seven days itself.
Mintcould not immediately ascertain if the company's global layoffs will affect current jobs and pace of hiring at Amazon India as well.
A recentCNBCreport suggested that Amazon mistakenly sent a notice via an internal email to some of its employees acknowledging “organisational changes” at the company.
“Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of applied AI solutions at AWS, wrote in the email, cited in the news portal's report. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organisation and AWS for future success.”
According to aReutersreport, the notice appeared to have been sent prematurely to Amazon Web Services (AWS) employees, a day before the next round of Amazon layoffs.
Last year, Amazon's CEO said that the rising use of AI tools would lead to more automation of duties, resulting in corporate job losses.
Although 30,000 jobs is a big number, it comprises nearly 10% of Amazon's corporate workforce, with the majority of its workers in fulfilment centres and warehouses, aReutersreport mentioned.
According to the agency report, the tech giant has been investing in robotics at its warehouses to speed up packaging and deliveries for its e-commerce segment in an effort to reduce the reliance on human labour and cut costs.
Companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft hired many people during the global pandemic of 2020 amid the demand surge, and now are restructuring their corporate workforce.

livemint,companies,"Navi Mumbai airport plans to start international operations in Q1FY27 after getting night flight permit, CEO Bansal says",CEO Arun Bansal emphasized the need for easier bilateral agreements to increase foreign airline operations.,https://www.livemint.com/companies/navi-mumbai-airport-international-operations-adani-airports-wings-india-2026-11769589634138.html,2026-01-28 11:00:54,"HYDERABAD: Gautam Adani-owned Navi Mumbai International Airport expects to start international operations in April-June, after obtaining clearance for night flying operations in the next month, the company’s top executive said.
“We are in the process of getting the night flight permit, after which the next step will be to start 24-hour domestic operations and in the first quarter of FY27 we will start international operations,"" Arun Bansal, chief executive officer of Adani Airport Holdings Ltd, toldMintat the Wings India 2026 event in Hyderabad on Wednesday.
Bansal also reiterated the need to ease bilateral agreements to allow foreign airlines to operate more flights to India – at least until Indian airlines build up sufficient capacity.
Bansal told reporters in October that international airlines are expected to join after the airport receives permits for night operations. Foreign carriers will get a one-year waiver on parking fees, which domestic carriers will not receive, Bansal said at the time.
Since 25 December 2025, there have been 23 daily departures from the airport. This is expected to increase to 34 daily departures starting in February, the operator said in a press statement in November.
The airport crossed 100,000 passengers within the first 19 days of commercial operations, according to the latest update. Navi Mumbai airport faces teething issues with regard to network connectivity. Lack of mobile network signals and patchy coverage have been reported at the newly inaugurated airport.
NMIAL is the eighth airport owned by Adani Airports Holding, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, which is the flagship company of the Ahmedabad based conglomerate.
Adani Airports operates and manages airports in India primarily through public-private partnerships. They include Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Jaipur, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai and Navi Mumbai airports.
Adani Airports is the second-largest airport operator in India in terms of revenue, behind GMR, which operates the Delhi, Hyderabad and Goa airports. GMR is modernizing Nagpur airport and developing Bhogapuram (Visakhapatnam). It also manages Bidar airport in Karnataka.
