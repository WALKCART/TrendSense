Today, gold and other precious metals occupy that position.
The bond vigilantes, as first coined by Wall Street veteran Ed Yardeni, sniff out government largess, corporate profligacy, geopolitical tremors, and inflation risks long before other financial assets and respond in kind. And by the sheer brute force of its size, bond markets force both the subjects of its wrath, and the investors that rely on them, into submission.
This year hasn’t seen much from the famed financial market guardians, however, despite a plethora of headline risks that should have triggered big repricings in Treasury bonds and the reshaping of the yield curve.
Inflation-inducing tariffs, a tax and spending bill that will add trillions to the U.S. debt pile, attacks on Federal Reserve independence, and a historic slump in the dollar have largely gone untested by the bond vigilantes.
Longer dated yields are definitely on the rise in some markets, but the U.S. Treasury curve has taken a “bull steepening” shape that reflects bets on deeper Fed rate cuts and an indifference to inflation risks heading into 2026.
Corporate credit spreads, which track the excess yields companies need to pay beyond risk-free Treasury bonds to access borrowing markets, are trading near the lowest levels on record.
The Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate, better known as the MOVE index and a key bond market volatility benchmark, is trading at the lowest levels since 2021. Broader market volatility gauges, such as the Cboe Group’s VIX index, are pinned at the lowest levels of the year.
That’s left much of this year’s heavy lifting to precious metals investors, who have kept global markets alert to issues such as currency debasement, inflation pressures, reckless government debt levels, and geopolitical angst with some of the biggest annual gains on record.
Gold prices have surged more than 70% since the start of the year, and topped the $4500 mark in early Wednesday trading, a record high that would have been nearly unthinkable just a few years ago.
Silver’s run has been even more impressive, rising just over 150% to blow past the $70 mark in what has been the strongest year for precious metals prices since 1979.
“We doubt this reflects a rebound in global economic activity, as prices of basic metals, which are more closely linked to industrial production, have increased by much less,” Ed Ed Yardeni said in a note published Tuesday by his Yardeni Research group.
“We suspect that the precious metals prices might be signaling recent concerns about an excessively stimulative combination of monetary and fiscal policies in the U.S. next year,” he added.
It’s also likely reflecting concern to the U.S. blockade of Venezuela’s oil exports, most of which are destined for China, as well as the lack of any progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.
“The risk of further escalation, particularly if it spreads to Venezuelan allies such as China or Russia, has added a geopolitical risk premium to gold,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.
Gold’s surge, and the conditions that underpin it, haven’t stood in the way of broader risk sentiment in equities, however. U.S. stocks are back to their winning ways and riding a four-day streak of gains that has the S&P 500 sitting at a fresh all-time peak.
Analysts are forecasting another year of double-digit percentage gains for the benchmark in 2026, with the current bull market likely to stretch into a fifth year on the back of artificial intelligence investments, a dovish central bank and a suddenly roaring domestic economy.
But all of it comes at a cost. U.S. debt is likely to top $40 trillion next year, based on current deficit projections, which won’t be helped by Trump administration plans for $2000 “tariff dividend” checks.
Tariffs, meanwhile, are likely to help keep headline inflation levels north of the Fed’s 2% target while AI and tech-led advances will continue to erode growth in the labor market.
Heading into 2026, however, it feels as if the only asset prices that will reflect that trade-off in equity growth will be found in the precious metals markets. And it could be bullish for both.
“The price of gold is rapidly approaching the S&P 500 stock price index,” Yardeni said. “If the S&P 500 reaches 10,000 by the end of 2029, as we expect, gold should trade at $10,000 if our trend analysis is correct.”

The company is in a transition phase where near-term earnings pressure is colliding with a capacity expansion that is yet to fully yield results.
That implies a sequential drop of nearly₹1,800 per tonne, driven by higher coking coal and iron ore costs. “Steel spreads are likely to weaken, but bottom in Q3FY26,” the brokerage said in its December visit note, adding that recovery should begin only from Q4FY26 as prices stabilize. This is the trough the market is currently fixated on.
As far as capacity addition is concerned, since September, Jindal Steel has commissioned 3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of new capacity, taking crude steel capacity to 12.6mtpa. Another 3mtpa is scheduled to come on stream by March, lifting the capacity to 15.6mtpa. Utilization remains low at around 40-45%, reflecting the early stage of ramp-up rather than a demand constraint. A timely ramp-up is central to the company’s volume outlook. Jindal Steel reiterated its FY26 sales guidance of 8.5-9mt. With H1FY26 volumes at about 3.8mt, this implies a sharp acceleration in the second half.
Given the company’s struggle with capacity constraints in recent years, a bigger shift lies beyond FY26 as the company enters a volume-led phase with capacities coming on-stream. Nuvama expects steel sales volumes to grow at a 17% compound annual growth rate over FY25-28, reaching about 12.7mt by FY28.
In this phase, earnings growth is driven primarily by volumes rather than a sharp rebound in prices. Also, a reset in the cost structure should aid. Several structural levers are nearing completion, including higher captive coal usage, commissioning of the slurry pipeline to reduce logistics costs and incremental captive power capacity. Together, these lower the marginal cost of incremental volumes, improving operating leverage even in a stable pricing environment.
Plus, the product mix has turned favourable: value-added steel accounted for over 73% of the sales mix in Q2FY26 versus 58% during Q2FY25, offering some insulation from commodity volatility.
Meanwhile, heavy capex has weighed on free cash flow so far in FY26, but as spending tapers and volumes rise, leverage is projected to fall sharply. Net debt-to-Ebitda is expected to move well below 1x over the next two years from 1.5x currently. With business moving past a capital-intensive phase of its transition, if volumes ramp up as planned and costs reset as expected, Jindal Steel’s earnings profile by FY28 could look materially different from today.

The rally has provided major relief to shareholders, as Apollo Micro Systems share price remained under prolonged pressure between early September and mid-December, eroding 26% of its value. However, the recent rally has helped recover the majority of these losses, reflecting the stock’s ability to quickly reverse declines.
The company, in its press release today, announced that it has received orders worth₹1,002.47 million from a private company, deliverable to the Ministry of Defence. The order is for the supply of unmanned aerial systems and is to be completed within a period of four months.
Earlier this week, the company also announced that it has received approvals from the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) for two distinct Transfers of Technology (ToT) relating to Laser-Based Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) systems and the EO Tracking System for DEW, subject to the fulfilment of prescribed conditions.
Directed energy weapon systems use high-powered lasers to inflict damage on targets. Compared to traditional weapons, which mainly rely on physical impact and kinetic energy, DEWs use directed energy to heat up, destroy, or damage targets.
The Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) technologies received through these Transfers of Technology will serve as an additional capability, complementing the company’s ongoing development efforts, particularly in view of the rapidly evolving threat landscape posed by aerial systems.
The company is currently developing critical anti-drone systems under the ‘Make’ category for the Indian Armed Forces, wherein both soft-kill and hard-kill solutions, including rocket-based interceptors, are being developed to counter swarm drone threats.
Last week, the company’s step-down subsidiary, IDL Explosives Limited, was granted a 15-year industrial licence for manufacturing high-energy defence explosives. The licence, issued under the IDR Act, 1951, represents a significant strategic expansion into specialised defence materials manufacturing.
Apollo Micro Systems six-day winning run has contributed to a 135% rally in 2025 so far, marking the sixth straight year of positive gains.
The shares have emerged as one of the biggest wealth creators in the Indian stock market, surging 1,000% in just three years and an even more impressive 2,180% over the last five years, highlighting the potential for wealth creation in equities when the right choices are made.

MUFG Bank would acquire a 20% stake in the company for₹39,620 crore of the company through a preferential allotment of shares. Under the deal, MUFG will acquire shares at₹840.93 apiece, representing a discount of around 3% to the stock’s closing price on December 18. It is one of the largest foreign investments ever seen in India’s non-banking finance space.
The NBFC stock fresh record highs for the third straight session on Wednesday, December 24. The stock touched an all-time high of₹983.7 during the session. However, in intra-day deals today, December 26, the stock declined 1.5% amid overall weak sentiment on Dalal Street.
Shriram Finance’s board has approved a preferential issue of₹39,618 crore to MUFG Bank through the issuance of 471 million equity shares at₹840.93 per share, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals from bodies such as the RBI and CCI. Post the transaction, MUFG will hold a 20% fully diluted stake, while the promoter and promoter group will own 20.3%, and the public shareholding will stand at 60%.
The transaction is expected to significantly strengthen Shriram Finance’s capital base, enhance balance sheet resilience and provide long-term growth capital. The investment has been described as the largest foreign direct investment (FDI) deal in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector.
Following the announcement, nearly every brokerage tracking the stock raised its price target. Nomura maintained its “buy” rating and lifted its target price to₹1,140. The brokerage said the deal would lead to a 24% accretion in book value per share, a 3.4 basis point dilution in return on equity, while return on assets could expand to 3.7%. Nomura also raised its AUM growth outlook to 20% from 17% earlier, citing an improved growth trajectory.
ICICI Securities also reiterated its BUY rating, factoring in book value accretion and rolling valuations to FY28E. “Factoring in book accretion and rolling to FY28E, analysts maintain valuation multiple at around 2.2x FY28E BV, implying a target price of₹1,200,” ICICI Securities said.
The brokerage highlighted management commentary on strong business visibility, especially in vehicle finance, and noted that growth guidance has been revised to 20% CAGR over the next 4–5 years, compared with an earlier estimate of 15%. ICICI Securities added that capital adequacy is expected to improve to 31% from 20.7%, potentially supporting a credit rating upgrade and lowering cost of funds by 50–75 basis points over time.
Motilal Oswal Financial Services described MUFG’s entry as a defining moment for the company. “The entry of MUFG as a strategic partner represents a transformative milestone for Shriram Finance, materially strengthening its capital base and enhancing its credit credibility. This strategic partnership not only de-risks the company’s growth trajectory but also expands its ability to serve a broader customer base across the CV, MSME, and retail segments, while reinforcing long-term franchise positioning,” the brokerage said.
With strong price action, improving fundamentals and heightened institutional interest, Shriram Finance remains firmly in the spotlight as investors track how the MUFG partnership reshapes the company’s growth journey in the sessions ahead.

An over 150% rise in silver prices in 2025 puts the white metal on track for the best annual gains in 46 years.
The precious metal has also been subject to inventory hoarding in China and the United States, creating a supply deficit.
But now some experts are turning wary of the sharp surge in silver, anticipating profit booking. According to them, the gold-silver ratio is now signalling a relative exhaustion insilver’s outperformance, but not a reversal for the metals complex.
In 2025, the ratio dropped 40% from 107 to 64, signalling a strong silver outperforming throughout the year.
Kedia Advisory data now suggests that the ratio is approaching the 62.5 structural support, aligning with the 100% Fibonacci retracement and past reversal zones seen in 2016 and 2021, which can potentially signal a reversal.
It added that though prices remain below the Ichimoku cloud and MACD signals weakness, the RSI is nearing the 30 mark — a rare, decade low condition, which signals downside exhaustion risk.
Echoing a cautious outlook on silver, Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market, said historically, such moves (outperformance of silver over gold) are followed by phases where gold stabilises, and silver corrects. ""This points to rotation within precious metals, not a breakdown. Gold may regain relative leadership during periods of risk aversion, while the broader bullish structure remains intact.”
Khoo highlighted that any pullback in silver prices from current levels should be viewed as a correction rather than a trend-ending setup, as inflation concerns, fiscal stress, and real-rate uncertainty remain supportive for precious metals.
Ajay Suresh Kedia, the founder and director of Kedia Advisory, expects the gold-silver ratio to have a key support level of 45.232 and a key resistance level of 76.190 over the next six-month period.
“Although there are red flags ahead, the long-term outlook for silver prices is that the precious metal will hit $100 per ounce over the next three years,” Kedia toldMint.
Kaveri More, Commodity Analyst at Choice Broking, however, does not see this rally in silver slowing down.
“Gold-silver ratioindicates continued silver outperformance in this bull market, as ratios below 70 historically favour silver due to its industrial demand divergence from gold's safe-haven dynamics, with support at 55-50 potentially cushioning any pullback,” said More.
Kaveri More also highlighted that the key level for Comex gold stands at a near-term resistance of $4,600-5,000 per ounce, while the support zone is at $4,250-4,150 per ounce amid the Federal Reserve's rate cuts and central bank buying.
In India, MCX gold prices hold a key near-term resistance level within₹140,000-151,000 per 10 grams, while the target stands at₹133,000-128,800 per 10 grams in 2026, according to the market expert.
The silver prices have a potential upside of $75-80 per ounce levels, with key support at $60-65 per ounce levels, the commodity market expert toldMint.The silver futures in India are expected to range between₹208,000-190,000 in 2026, and between₹230,000-250,000 in the near-term period.

Meanwhile, RailTel and IRFC shares surged up to 9%. IRCTC share price also rose nearly 5% to₹704 apiece.
A major catalyst for today’s movement is a growing optimism ahead of the Union Budget 2026. Railway stocks typically attract buying interest in the run-up to the Budget, as investors factor in the likelihood of increased capital spending on infrastructure, rolling stock, and network upgrades.
Following a subdued performance in 2025, investors seem to be re-entering railway stocks, wagering that the government will maintain railways as a key focus of its broader infrastructure development agenda.
The recent rationalisation in railway passenger fares has further buoyed sentiment, with even marginal increases being welcomed by markets as they point to better revenue visibility across the railways ecosystem.
Companies like IRCTC, which earn from ticketing volumes, catering, and ancillary services, are viewed as indirect beneficiaries of improved passenger economics—helping in the stock’s movement despite its otherwise defensive business profile.
“Indian railway stocks are rising as investors are factoring higher record budgetary allocations to Railways, and faster execution of projects like station redevelopment, electrification, Vande Bharat trains and dedicated freight corridors in the coming few quarters,” said Prashanth Tapse, Sr. VP Research analyst at Mehta Equities.
Tapse explained that strong improvement in order inflows, increasing revenue visibility, improved delivery and execution, operating leverage, and balance-sheet strength of key railway PSUs are supporting earnings upgrades, while structural policy continuity to push and improve long-term return expectations can lead to long-term re-rating for the sector.
“As the dedicated financing arm of Indian Railways, one of the world’s largest rail networks, IRFC is a direct beneficiary of sustained government capex on rolling stock, electrification, freight corridors, and capacity augmentation. The company’s AAA credit ratings and sovereign-linked borrower profile translate into near-zero credit risk, highly predictable cash flows, and strong asset quality, making its business model structurally stable across market cycles. This unique positioning offers investors low-risk exposure to the railways theme, supported by steady annuity-like earnings and potential valuation re-rating as financing volumes and execution momentum improve,” Tapse added.
On the other hand, Drumil Vithlani, Technical Research Analyst at Bonanza, has suggested that investors look at RailTel Corp, saying that the stock has given a breakout from a Falling Wedge pattern on the daily timeframe, indicating a short-term bullish bias.
“The structure remains constructive with short-term strength already visible on daily charts, while a confirmed weekly breakout could open the door for a broader medium-term move. Additionally, volume expansion during the daily breakout highlights strong buyer participation and willingness to accumulate the stock at higher levels,” Vithlani said.

International silver prices have soared 158% year-to-date. In comparison, gold has surged nearly 72% in the same period. Domestic spot silver prices have jumped 156% this year, compared with an 80% gain in spot gold.
On Friday, December 26, MCX gold February futures rose nearly 1% to a fresh record high of₹1,39,216 per 10 grams, while MCX silver March contracts surged 4% to a record high of₹2,32,741 per kg.
A confluence of factors acted in favour of silver prices this year. let's take a look:
Silver is witnessing strong industrial demand, especially from the sunrise sectors such as electric vehicles (EV), solar, semiconductors, and data centres. According to reports, more than half of all silver produced, or nearly 55–60% of total global silver demand, is consumed by industries. Data from the Silver Institute shows that silver's industrial demand reached a new record high for the fourth consecutive year in 2024, as it rose 4% last year to 680.5 million ounces (Moz).
""Silver is driven by the growing demand for it, emerging as a safe-haven metal, with increasing usages in solar power, electronic gadgets, and electric cars, apart from low supply levels and heightened investor flows,"" said Aksha Kamboj, Vice President for India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) and Executive Chairperson of Aspect Global Ventures.
While demand is high, silver supply remains tight, creating an environment of scarcity-driven prices. According to the Silver Institute’s latest report, the silver market is witnessing multi-year deficits.
The Silver Institute report states that global silver demand has exceeded silver supply for the fourth consecutive year, resulting in a structural market deficit of 148.9 Moz in 2024. During 2021-2024, the combined deficit reached 678 Moz, equivalent to 10 months of global mine supply in 2024.
While it is true that silver is witnessing heightened demand amid tight supply, experts also see the FOMO (fear of missing out) factor at play. Due to the sharp rise in silver and gold prices this year, more and more retail investors are buying silver as they anticipate the continuation of the uptrend.
""Apart from fundamentals, we are seeing a FOMO-driven rally among speculators, which has further accelerated the price move. Silver has touched a psychological level of around $75, adding to bullish sentiment,"" said Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities.
""While the U.S. has indicated the possibility of two interest rate cuts next year, markets are currently factoring in at least one. Regardless, the overall undertone remains positive for precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum,"" said Trivedi.
""The recent US military action in Nigeria related to ISIS, along with ongoing conflicts involving Russia and Ukraine, has created uncertainty in global markets. This has led to euphoria in bullion commodities overall,"" said Trivedi.
Gold and silver prices are scaling fresh highs almost daily. Experts believe there could be some intermittent technical pullbacks after such a sharp rally. However, aggressive sell-offs look unlikely. The broader sentiment remains supportive.
""With almost 7$ difference between the price of silver on Comex and Shanghai, the global arbitrage system and price discovery mechanism of silver has collapsed (normally this difference is less than $1). The silver price may further surprise everyone, as it is moving from the LBMA vault to China for better pricing,"" said Kamboj.

""I believe silver is just getting started, and I believe $70- $200 silver could be an outside reality in 2026. There are many reasons I state $200 silver is possible,"" Kiyosaki said in his post on X.
Kiyosaki said that his outlook is shaped by decades of experience. He said he began acquiring silver in 1965, when prices were less than $1 an ounce, and continues to buy even at today’s elevated levels.
Rather than urging blind investment, Kiyosaki encouraged people to do their own research. He advised potential buyers to explore different viewpoints before making decisions.
He said that when you study and learn from your mistakes, learn from your wins and losses, you will become a truly rich person.
The latest round of rally in silver prices follows heightened geopolitical tensions in Venezuela and continued hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. The US is focusing on enforcing a ""quarantine"" of Venezuelan oil for the next two months, driving safe-haven appeal of silver.
Investors continue to price in two quarter-point rate cuts by the Federal Reserve next year as inflation cools and labour market conditions soften, even as Fed officials remain divided on the path ahead. Lower interest rates increase the appeal of non-interest-yielding assets like gold and silver.
Strong inflows into exchange-traded funds, strong industrial demand and silver's critical role in manufacturing, with applications ranging from electronics and solar panels to coatings used in medical devices, have also pushed silver prices higher this year.

UBS has upgraded Titan Company from Neutral to Buy and raised its target price to₹4,700 from₹3,600, implying an upside potential of over 18% from current levels. The brokerage described Titan as a structural winner in the jewellery industry, adding that it appears to be on the cusp of a rebound after a prolonged period of underperformance.
“We view Titan as an impressive player in the jewellery industry, with strong brands, consumer trust and scale. While we think Titan’s value proposition remains competitive. On its attractive valuation, we expect an earnings rebound,” UBS said.
The brokerage added that after nearly two years of stagnation, Titan’s shares appear well positioned for a stronger phase of growth. With the jewellery margin reset—undertaken to keep gold pricing competitive for consumers—largely behind it, UBS expects a meaningful improvement in earnings ahead.
Titan’s bullish brokerage upgrade comes on the back of a solid second-quarter performance. For Q2FY26, Titan Company reported a 42.7% year-on-year rise in net profit to₹1,006 crore. Revenue for the quarter rose 25.1% YoY to₹16,534 crore. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) also increased 43% YoY to₹1,620 crore.
Operating margins improved to 9.8% from 8.6% a year earlier, though they remained below the Street’s expectation of 11%. The jewellery division continued to be Titan’s primary growth engine. Jewellery sales rose 21% to₹14,092 crore, excluding bullion and DigiGold.

Internationally, spot silver jumped 3.6% to $74.56 per ounce, after touching an all-time high of $75.14.
Silver is also witnessing strong industrial demand, especially from the sunrise sectors such as electric vehicles (EV), solar, semiconductors, and data centres.
While demand is high, silver supply remains tight, creating an environment of scarcity-driven prices. According to the Silver Institute’s latest report, the silver market is witnessing multi-year deficits.
While it is true that silver is witnessing heightened demand amid tight supply, experts also see the FOMO (fear of missing out) factor at play.
Rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve and expectations of further rate reductions are driving a rally in non-yielding assets like gold and silver.

So far in 2025, Ola Electric shares are down nearly 58%, underlining the pressure the stock has faced despite intermittent positive triggers.
In its exchange filing, Ola Electric said the sanctioned amount relates to the demand incentive for determined sales value for FY25 under the PLI-Auto scheme. The company stated that it received the sanction order from the Ministry of Heavy Industries for the release of incentives through IFCI Limited, the designated financial institution responsible for disbursement under the scheme.
The company added that the incentive has been sanctioned strictly in line with the applicable terms and conditions of the PLI-Auto Scheme, as amended from time to time. Ola Electric said the development reinforces its position as a key contributor to India’s advanced automotive manufacturing ecosystem, reflecting strong execution across scale, localisation and technology-led vertically integrated manufacturing.
Commenting on the development, an Ola Electric spokesperson said, “The sanction of₹366.78 crore under the PLI-Auto Scheme is a strong endorsement of Ola Electric’s manufacturing capabilities and our commitment to building world-class EV technology in India.”
The spokesperson added that the incentive recognises the company’s sustained efforts in scaling domestic production, deepening localisation and driving innovation across the electric mobility value chain. “We remain committed to supporting the Government of India’s vision of making India a global hub for advanced automotive manufacturing and clean mobility,” the spokesperson said.
The PLI-Auto Scheme was approved by the Union Cabinet on September 15, 2021, with a total budgetary outlay of₹25,938 crore for a five-year period from FY23 to FY27. The scheme aims to boost domestic manufacturing of Advanced Automotive Technology (AAT) products, including electric vehicles and their components, reduce import dependence, strengthen local supply chains and generate employment.
Separately, Ola Electric provided an update last week regarding its promoter shareholding. The company confirmed the completion of a one-time, limited monetisation of a portion of the founder Bhavish Agarwal's personal shareholding, which was undertaken to fully repay a promoter-level loan of around₹260 crore.
Following this transaction, all 3.93% shares that were previously pledged have been released, bringing the promoter’s pledge in the company down to zero, the Bengaluru-based firm said. The company clarified that the monetisation was executed entirely at the promoter’s personal level, carried out in tranches, and was time-bound.
Post the transaction, the promoter group continues to hold more than 34.5% stake in Ola Electric, among the highest promoter ownership levels seen across new-age listed companies. Ola Electric also emphasised that the exercise does not involve any dilution of promoter control and reflects no change in the founder’s long-term conviction in the company.

MSCI Inc.’s gauge of EM equities rose as much as 0.6% in Asian trading to its highest level since Nov. 14. Tech-heavy markets of South Korea and Taiwan led regional gains, with shares of Samsung Electronics Co. climbing to an all-time high. Up 2.2% over five sessions, the stock gauge was on track for its best weekly advance since the period ended Nov. 28. Markets in Indonesia and Hong Kong were closed for a holiday.
A measure of developing-nation currencies took its gain since last Friday to 0.6%, headed for a fourth straight weekly increase and the biggest since August.
While EM stocks look poised to finish 2025 on a high after having rallied 30% so far this year, market watchers say the outlook depends on trends in artificial intelligence and the path of Federal Reserve’s interest rates — both of which remain uncertain.
“AI theme conviction remains uneven. That is the most important driver,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore. The push higher “can extend if US dollar stays soft, but the bigger test comes when liquidity returns in early January.”
The Korean won led EM currencies higher on Friday amid a weaker greenback and inflows into local stocks. The won strengthened to its strongest since Nov. 4 after authorities earlier this week said excessive weakness in the currency isn’t desirable and foreign-exchange markets will soon see the government’s “strong determination.”
Meanwhile, China’s yuan was steady after the central bank set its daily reference rate at a level that was below market estimates by a record margin in the latest sign of policymakers’ intention to slow the currency’s appreciation. The move came after the offshore yuan strengthened past the psychological milestone of 7 per dollar on Thursday for the first time since September 2024.

The Nifty 50 index opened at 26,121.25, slipping marginally by 20.85 points or 0.08 per cent, while the BSE Sensex began the session at 85,225.28, declining by 183.42 points or 0.21 per cent.
Market experts attributed the subdued opening to persistent selling by foreign investors and thin year-end trading volumes.
Ajay Bagga, Banking and Market expert, told ANI, ""Indian markets are pointing to a weak start. FPIs have been net sellers on each of the last three days. With year-end volumes expected to be low, the weak momentum in Indian markets suggests there will be no Santa rally. On Wednesday, all sectors except media and metals closed down. This morning's cues are also weak. The focus will now shift to three big catalysts for 2026. The Union Budget 2026, which will see a pre-Budget surge in industrials, railways, and defence stocks in anticipation, will also be followed by further FTA talks with the EU and US, and finally, the earnings season by mid-January. Earnings are expected to show an uptick, and markets will start moving in anticipation of this.""
Despite the current sluggishness, Indian markets have shown resilience in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2025. For Q4 CY2025, Indian equities have remained broadly on par with both emerging markets (EMs) and developed markets (DMs), even amid the sharp depreciation of the Indian rupee in December.
Experts believe momentum is gradually shifting upward and that the combined impact of the Budget, FTAs, and earnings could lead to a strong first quarter of CY2026 for Indian stocks. For now, markets are winding down a disappointingly slow year, with hope intact but momentum still weak.
Fund flow data for the cash market on December 24 showed FPIs selling shares worth₹1,721.3 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) provided support with net purchases of₹2,381.3 crore.
Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said, ""On the daily timeframe, Nifty remains in a consolidation phase within a broader uptrend. The index continues to hold firmly above the 20-day EMA at 26,073 and the psychologically important 26,000 mark, keeping the short-term structure constructive. Price action since mid-year continues to reflect higher highs and higher lows, with the index trading comfortably above rising moving averages, indicating that the broader trend remains intact despite recent consolidation"".
In the broader market, most indices traded in the red. The Nifty Smallcap 1000 was the sole gainer, rising 0.17 per cent, while the Nifty 100 slipped 0.06 per cent and the Nifty Midcap 100 declined 0.04 per cent.
On the sectoral front, the Nifty Media, Nifty Metal and Nifty Pharma indices opened in the green. In contrast, the Nifty IT index opened lower by 0.14 per cent, while Nifty FMCG, auto and PSU bank indices were also flat to negative. (ANI)

The stock has lost 28% over the past six months and 24% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis.
AnEconomic Timesreport, citing sources, states that the CERC is considering a lower, uniform fee of around 1.5 paise per kilowatt-hour (kWh) per side across most trading segments.
Currently, exchanges charge a fee of 2 paise per kWh on both the buying and selling sides, resulting in a total fee of approximately 4 paise per kWh.
Another suggestion involves lowering the transaction fee of 1.25 paise/unit for term-ahead market (TAM) contracts due to the longer nature of such contracts.
According to the report, IEX has little incentive to reduce fee under the current structure, while other exchanges have little financial headroom to undercut pricing.
Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVAsset PMS, said that the regulator is evaluating a lower fixed fee structure to improve transparency and reduce costs for market participants — a move that could directly impact exchange-level profitability.
For IEX, transaction fees form a meaningful portion of revenues, and any downward revision could lead to margin compression, particularly in the short term. “While volumes on the exchange remain structurally strong, the market is factoring in the risk of reduced pricing power as regulatory oversight intensifies. The proposed changes also come at a time when market coupling is expected to be implemented over the medium term, which could further normalise fee structures across exchanges,” he added.
In the near term, he expects earnings sensitivity to fee revisions is likely to remain a key overhang for IEX.

Boxing Day, observed on December 26, is a public holiday in several countries including the UK, Ireland, Australia and parts of Europe. The holiday traces its origins to the tradition of distributing “Christmas boxes” to workers and the less fortunate on the day after Christmas. In modern financial markets, Boxing Day is associated with widespread exchange closures and sharply reduced participation, often leading to thin trading conditions and subdued price action in markets that remain open.
Japan’s TOPIX climbed to a fresh record high and was last up 0.5%. South Korea’s benchmark index rose 0.6%, pushing its gains for the year to 72%, making it the best-performing major stock market globally in 2025. China’s blue-chip index advanced 0.27% and is on track to end the year up 18%, marking its strongest annual performance since 2020.
MSCI’s broad Asia-Pacific stock gauge rose for a sixth consecutive session, lifting it to its highest level since November 14. The index was last up 0.4% and has gained 25% so far this year, reflecting strong year-end momentum despite holiday disruptions. This followed record-high closes for US equities on Wednesday, ahead of the Christmas break.
Beyond equities, precious metals dominated market attention. Spot silver surged more than 4% on Friday to a record high, while gold also touched a fresh peak, last trading at $4,503.39 per ounce. The rally has been underpinned by geopolitical concerns, particularly rising tensions as Washington steps up pressure on Caracas by blockading sanctioned oil vessels linked to Venezuela.
Attention is also on Donald Trump, with investors awaiting his nomination for the next Fed chair to replace Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May. Any clarity on this front could influence markets as trading resumes more fully in the final days of the year.

International gold prices are also surging. US gold futures February contracts rose by 0.7% to a record high of $4,533.60 per ounce, driven by safe-haven demand amid mounting geopolitical tensions as well as expectations of US interest rate cuts.
Trivedi added that the rate cut hopes are also favouring the bullion process. Markets are pricing in two quarter-point rate cuts by the Fed next year as inflation cools and labour market conditions soften.
According to Trivedi, MCX gold February futures are likely to stay positive, and₹1,39,000 per 10 grams is the next resistance for today.

On the other hand, Indigo, Adani Enterprise, and Dr Reddy experienced selling pressure and ended as major laggards. The broader market presented a mixed picture as Nifty Midcap 100 slipped 0.60%, while the Nifty Small-cap index bucked the trend with a 0.3% gain. Market breadth turned weak after three days, reflected in a BSE advance-decline ratio of 0.79.
Speaking on the outlook of the Nifty 50 index, Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said, ""On the daily timeframe, Nifty 50 remains in a consolidation phase within a broader uptrend. The index continues to hold firmly above the 20-day EMA at 26,073 and the psychologically significant 26,000 mark, maintaining a constructive short-term structure. Price action since mid-year has continued to reflect higher highs and higher lows, with the index trading comfortably above rising moving averages, indicating that the broader trend remains intact despite recent consolidation. Immediate support is placed at 26,050–26,000, reinforced by Put OI concentration and the 20-day EMA, making this zone a buy-on-dips area from a risk-reward perspective.""
Ponmudi said that on the upside, resistance is visible at 26,250–26,330, with a broader supply zone extending toward 26,385–26,500. Failure to decisively clear this overhead supply is likely to keep the index range-bound. As long as the Nifty sustains a closing price above 26,000, dips toward support may offer low-risk long opportunities, with a protective stop placed below 25,950. The medium-term bias remains neutral to mildly bullish, with directional clarity expected only on a decisive breakout beyond the upper range.
On the outlook of the Bank Nifty index, Ponmudi said, ""The Bank Nifty index continues to show a mixed and slightly lagging structure relative to the broader market. The index remains in consolidation, with the 20-day EMA near 59,128 acting as immediate support. Key downside levels to monitor are 59,000–58,900; a sustained breakdown below 58,800 could open the door for a deeper corrective move toward 58,500. On the upside, the range of 59,500–59,600 remains a strong resistance zone. A convincing move above this band is required to revive momentum and unlock upside toward 59,800–60,000. Until then, price action is likely to stay sideways, driven by stock-specific moves in private banks and prevailing liquidity conditions.""
The uptrend in the bullion market continued on Friday, as the gold rate today in the international market hit a new peak of $ 4,531 per troy ounce, while the silver rate today touched a new lifetime high of $75.13 per ounce. According to experts, gold and silver prices have witnessed a sharp surge amid declining global interest rates and heightened geopolitical uncertainties.
""Prices are continuously going up because the interest rates are going down across the world,"" said Anantha Padmanaban, founder member and former chairman of the All India Gem & Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC), adding, ""
Following two days of consolidation, the Indian rupee depreciated by 13 paise against the US dollar, lagging its Asian peers on Wednesday. This decline was driven by a shift toward risk aversion, fueled by persistent capital withdrawals from foreign investors leading up to the holiday break, alongside heightened dollar demand from bullion importers.
""The outlook for spot USDINR maintains an upward trajectory provided it holds above the 89.00 mark; however, the 90.30 level continues to act as a formidable resistance for further gains,"" said Dilip Parmar, Senior Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.
Hindustan Zinc shares are trading near₹625 and remain firmly in a strong bullish trend, reflecting sustained buying interest and positive market sentiment. The stock has exhibited a sharp upward move following a prolonged period of consolidation, supported by strong momentum and healthy trading volumes. It continues to trade comfortably above all its key moving averages, which are aligned upward, indicating a well-established and stable trend. The formation of consistent bullish candles suggests continued strength and participation from market participants.
The Can Fin Homes share price is currently trading at₹948, maintaining a strong upward trajectory. The stock has consistently formed higher highs and higher lows, reflecting sustained bullish momentum. It recently reached a 52-week high of 948.5. A breakout above this level could further accelerate buying interest. The Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) for the 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day periods are all trending upward, reinforcing the bullish outlook.
Stock has been exhibiting a strong and consistent bullish pattern, indicating sustained investor interest and positive price momentum. The stock is currently trading at₹1737 and has established a solid support base at₹1700. This level has historically acted as a cushion, and the recent price action suggests a reversal from this support, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The technical setup suggests a potential price retracement toward the₹1,795 level in the near term. Given the renewed strength and favourable risk-reward ratio, entering at the current market price with a stop-loss placed at₹1700 presents a strategic opportunity to capture the expected upside move. The outlook remains positive as long as the stock holds above its key support zone.
The stock has exhibited a notable, strong bullish pattern, offering another promising opportunity for short-term traders. The stock is currently priced at₹2,108 and is maintaining a strong support level at₹2,070. The technical setup suggests a potential price retracement towards the₹2170 level. With the stock reversing from a support base and showing signs of renewed strength, entering at the current market price with a stop-loss at₹2070 offers a prudent approach to capturing the anticipated upside.
The stock has exhibited a notable, strong bullish pattern, offering another promising opportunity for short-term traders. The stock is currently priced at₹262 and maintains a strong support at₹252. The technical setup suggests a potential price retracement towards the₹270 level. With the stock reversing from a support base and showing signs of renewed strength, entering at the current market price with a stop-loss at₹252 offers a prudent approach to capturing the anticipated upside.
The stock has recently witnessed a gradual correction from the₹1335 level. It has taken support near the₹1115 zone, with a positive reversal indicated by a move above the critical 200-period MA at the₹1150 level, suggesting further upward movement in the coming days. The RSI has gained significantly from the oversold zone, signalling a buy, and with upside potential visible, it can continue the positive move further ahead. With the chart technically looking good and attractive, we suggest buying the stock for an upside target of₹1,250, keeping the stop-loss at the₹1,175 level.
The stock has been in an overall consolidation phase, currently moving above the critical 50-DEMA level at₹527, with decent volume participation to improve the bias. It can be expected to rise further in the coming days. The RSI is well-positioned with a buy signal indication, showing much upside potential and indicating a potential for a further positive move ahead. With the chart technically looking good and attractive, we suggest buying the stock with an upside target of₹560, while maintaining a strict stop-loss at the₹520 level.
The stock, after a significant correction, has shown signs of bottoming out near the₹4000 zone and has picked up with a series of positive candle formations accompanied by rising volume participation, visible on the daily chart, to improve the overall bias. This is expected to lead to a further rise in the coming days. The RSI has risen from the oversold zone to signal a buy. With the chart technically looking attractive, we suggest buying the stock for an upside target of₹4,550, keeping the stop-loss at the₹4,200 level.

Prices on the London Metal Exchange rose to nearly $3,400 per tonne in mid-December, about 35% higher than the April lows, driven by a sharp drop in inventories. Although prices have since eased, they remain above the FY25 average of $2,875 per tonne. A $100 per tonne increase in zinc prices boosts HZL’s Ebitda by roughly 4%.
Nevertheless, earnings growth is expected to be solid. Despite modest volume growth, Jefferies India expects earnings per share (EPS) to rise at a strong 22% and 29% in FY26 and FY27, respectively, and 7% in FY28, along with robust cash flows and return on equity (ROE). “Our FY26-28 estimated EPS are 9-31% above Street,” said Jefferies’ analysts in a report on 14 December. “We expect strong free cash flow at₹8000-14,800 crore per year and 69-85% ROE over FY26-28E,” they added.
In addition to higher realizations, HZL’s cost of production is declining, aided by improved recovery rates and lower power costs as the share of renewable energy (RE) increases.
Zinc cost of production excluding royalty stood at $1,002 per tonne in H1FY26, down 8% year-on-year and 20% lower than the FY23 peak of $1,257 per tonne. The company aims to raise RE adoption to 55% by FY27 and 70% by FY28, from 7% in FY25. Emkay estimates that costs fall by $1 per tonne for every 2% increase in RE share, helping offset mining cost inflation.
The HZL stock trades at an enterprise value of about 12x FY27 estimated Ebitda, as per Bloomberg data. While the valuation looks demanding, firm silver prices would keep investors’ interest alive in the stock.

The benchmark index closed with a mild loss of 0.13% at 26,142.10 due to the absence of fresh domestic triggers and mixed global cues.
As the year draws to a close, the market is witnessing muted volume and weak breadth due to the holiday season. Investors appear cautious ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season. Two IT majors- HCL Tech and TCS- will announce their December quarter results on January 12.
According to Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, for fresh momentum, stronger participation from the banking index will be essential. He says a decisive breakout above the 59,500 level in the Bank Nifty will likely fuel the next leg of the up move.
""Focus on sectors showing consistent outperformance, such as private banks, metals and auto, and adhere to disciplined risk management in the low-volume environment,"" Mishra said.
""We maintain a positive bias amid the ongoing consolidation in the index and continue to recommend a buy-on-dips approach as long as the Nifty holds its prevailing uptrend,"" said Mishra.
Mishra recommends buying the following three stocks for the next one to two weeks, highlighting a favourable technical setup for them.
After emerging from a corrective phase, the stock has demonstrated resilience by sustaining above its 20-day EMA. It has also formed a fresh pivot resembling a flag pattern, indicating a continuation of the ongoing uptrend.
""Considering the supportive sectoral backdrop and positive chart structure, traders may consider long positions in HCL Tech within the mentioned range,"" said Mishra.
As Mishra highlighted, after breaking out of a cup and handle continuation pattern, the stock saw a mild retracement and has since formed a fresh base, indicating healthy consolidation.
The broader structure remains firmly placed within a strong uptrend, and the recent range breakout suggests potential for further upside.
Additionally, the weekly RSI has registered a fresh bullish crossover, pointing to a revival in positive momentum.
""In view of the supportive technical structure, traders may consider initiating long positions in the stock within the specified parameters,"" said Mishra.
The stock continues to trade comfortably above its short- and medium-term moving averages, with the rising 50-DMA acting as a dynamic support, while the long-term 200-DMA remains firmly upward sloping, reinforcing the broader uptrend.
Momentum indicators appear to be strengthening, suggesting scope for continuation.
""As long as the price holds above the breakout zone, the stock is likely to trend higher, with any minor pullback offering a potential buy-on-dips opportunity,"" said Mishra.

Most markets, including India, were closed on Thursday for the Christmas holiday.
Both the Nifty and Sensex hit record highs in November after 14 months, but have remained muted so far in December, shedding about 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.
""While the medium-term structural outlook for Indian markets remains constructive, thin liquidity conditions and year-end book squaring are likely to cap sharp directional moves in the near term,"" said Ponmudi R, chief executive officer at Enrich Money.
Year-end book squaring is a process where financial institutions, such as banks and investment firms, close out or rebalance their positions to tidy up books.
This contributes to muted activity as firms refrain from taking new positions, leading to lower liquidity and fewer trades in the market.
Average daily trading volumes of Nifty 50 stocks in December have been around 250 million shares, compared with about 300 million shares in the previous month, signalling lower activity as the year comes to an end.

Tell us what you think at feedback@livemint.com.
This year, gold and silver outshone equity markets as foreign investors pulled out of Indian stocks amid high valuations and tepid earnings growth. The tables may somewhat turn in 2026 as experts bet on the return of overseas buyers and bullion to remain range-bound. Yet, uncertainty is expected to prevail for small- and mid-caps, and large-caps are most likely to continue outperforming, according to market participants. Also, the market regulator’s clampdown on futures and options to protect retail investors did yield some results this year. But the real picture will emerge only next year.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have staged one of their sharpest retreats from Indian equities in recent years, pulling out$17.9billion in 2025 so far. The outflow is the largest among major emerging markets this year, signalling a decisive shift in global risk appetite. Investors are rotating out of expensive markets and reallocating to regions offering clearer policy signals and more attractive valuations.
Japan has emerged as the only standout beneficiary of this shift, drawing a massive $45.7 billion in FPI inflows—its strongest run in years. Across the rest of Asia, capital outflows continued but remained significantly smaller than India’s exodus. Taiwan has seen withdrawals of $8.6 billion, followed by Malaysia at $4.9 billion, South Korea at $5 billion, Vietnam at $4.8 billion and Thailand at $3.1 billion. Indonesia recorded outflows of $1.3 billion, while the Philippines saw outflows of only $879 million.
After three consecutive years of relentless gains, bullion enters 2026 with immense popularity and a sharper question hanging over it: could crowded bets on gold and silver blunt future returns?
Gold’s surge has been unusually powerful and broad-based. It soared nearly80%in 2025 after rising 26% and 15% in 2024 and 2023, respectively.Gold hit more than 50 all-time highs in 2025, driven by aggressive central bank buying, war-related safe-haven demand and expectations of Fed rate cuts.
Silver followed the same path but with far bigger swings. It climbed155%in 2025, following strong double-digit gains in the last two years, on both investment demand and its growing use in solar panels, electric vehicles and electronics.
Gains for 2026 may be far more measured, with a more cautious US Federal Reserve, elevated real US treasury yields and cooling price momentum likely to keep bullion range-bound.
Experts remain optimistic about gold, citing central bank diversification. The World Gold Council forecasts gold to trade within a range of –5% and +5% in 2026, though a growth slowdown or geopolitical risks could trigger gains of 5-30%. Silver is anticipated to trade between $48 and $70 an ounce in 2026, with possible spikes to $75 if rate cuts accelerate or industrial demand spikes.
The BSE SmallCap index, which had surged 47.52% in 2023 and 29.31% in 2024, has fallen over6%in 2025, marking its sharpest underperformance in five years. Midcaps have also stalled, deliveringflat returnsversus the blockbuster 45.53% and 26.07% gains in the previous two years. The widening gap signals a strong rotation toward stability, earnings visibility and liquidity—factors that have favoured large-cap stocks through a volatile global backdrop.
The small- and mid-cap (Smid) space is hard hit as stretched valuations in this segment have become difficult to justify, with multiples now nearly double their long-term averages. Yet, selective opportunities are emerging across financials, IT and consumer durables. Market strategists highlight that the valuation divide is partly structural, as Smid baskets favour higher-growth sectors, justifying richer multiples.
Still, this cycle of large-cap outperformance is likely to continue even next year amid a broader valuation reset.
After years of runaway speculation that saw trading in futures and options (F&O) explode, 2025 became the year Sebi finally intervened. With average daily notional turnover on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE doubling every year for roughly five years, it peaked at₹537 trillion in September 2024.
Following this, the market regulator rolled out a series of curbs throughout 2025: tighter risk disclosures, restrictions on far-out-of-the-money contracts, a hike in securities transaction tax, stricter margin rules and a sharp cutback in weekly expiries.
The impact was pronounced. By the September quarter of FY26, overall derivatives activity had plunged 20% compared to the previous year—the first meaningful cooling since the boom.
After peaking in September last year, Indian equities endured a wobbly ride, only recently returning to fresh highs amid continued market volatility. Despite some recent decline, valuations remain elevated, with more than a quarter of listed firms trading at lofty valuations, above 40 times their earnings, signalling expensive pockets persist in the market despite a cooling sentiment through 2025. Nearly 15% of BSE-listed firms currently command P/E multiples above 80x. Another10.6%sit in the 40–60x band, while15.4%trade at 25–40x, reinforcing that elevated valuations remain deeply entrenched even as earnings momentum has normalised this year. Roughly24.7%of listed firms now trade at a more reasonable 10–25x P/E.
India’s valuation premium is even more striking in a global context. The Nifty 50 trades at a 12-month forward P/E of24.3 times—well above most major Asian peers and higher than several developed-market benchmarks. Among major indices, only the S&P 500, at25.2x, commands a richer multiple. In contrast, Taiwan’s Taiex(22.8x), Japan’s Nikkei 225(22.2x)and Indonesia’s Jakarta Composite(21.5x) all trade at lower valuations. India has carried this pricey tag for years, and 2026 is expected to be no different.
While the headline indices largely remained range-bound, only a handful of sectors saw meaningful gains this year. Public-sector banks have emerged as the year’s standout performers. The Nifty PSU Bank index has surged27%so far in 2025, supported by improving asset quality, stronger credit growth and continued institutional buying. Automobiles follow closely, with theNifty Metal index up 24%,rising on premiumization and supply-chain normalization.
Auto(22%),financial services (17%) and private banks(15%) round out the list of top gainers. Defence-linked stocks too remain buoyant, with the Nifty India Defence index rising20% year-to-date. Broader cyclical sectors have posted moderate returns. Commodities (15%) and infrastructure(13%)have held firm, while the consumption index has risen8%, signalling uneven demand recovery across categories.
But amid rising volatility and tightening global liquidity, several pockets of the market slipped into negative territory. Defensives such as healthcare are down 1%, energy isflat, and pharma is lower by 3%. FMCG has declined 4% amid weakening rural demand and margin pressures.
The steepest fall, however, is seen in IT, which is down10%so far this year, hurt by global spending cuts and cautious deal pipelines. Realty has dropped16%and media was down 22%, making them the worst performers of 2025. Will the tables turn next year?

The cabinet on Friday approved a record budget for the next fiscal year, aiming to strike a balance between proactive fiscal policy and debt management.

The rebound in JGBs came after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi sought to ease concerns over her massive stimulus plan, and a Reuters report said the government would likely reduce new issuance of super-long bonds next fiscal year.

Silver rates in India were also at record high levels following the global Silver record run.
Rising speculations of further rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in January also aided the sentiment. Moreover, Gold prices also hit a new high in today's deals.
Back home, MCX silver March futures surged 4% to a record high of₹2,32,741 per kg while MCX gold February futures also rose by 0.65% to hit a record high of₹1,38,994 per 10 grams.
Silver’s performance this year has been particularly striking. The metal has surged 138% over the past one year, 99% in six months, 59% in three months, and 39% in one month, highlighting both the speed and scale of the rally.
The recent rise in the white metal has been supported by strong speculative inflows and persistent supply dislocations across key trading centres, lingering since a historic short squeeze in October.
In addition, geopolitical tensions in Venezuela—where the US has blockaded oil tankers and intensified pressure on the government of Nicolás Maduro—have further boosted silver’s appeal as a safe-haven asset.
This optimism has held firm despite a strong third-quarter GDP reading, which suggests the US economy remains on a solid footing. Investors are also hopeful that the next Fed Chair could take a more dovish stance than Jerome Powell and align more closely with US President Donald Trump’s preference for lower interest rates.
“What sets silver apart is its wide application in industrial uses. In the modern sunrise industries like EVs, solar energy, manufacture of electronic devices mobile phones etc silver is used. The impressive growth of these industries have pushed up the demand for silver. In the absence of corresponding increase in supply of this scarce metal, price has shot up. There can be some profit booking, but silver prices are likely to remain resilient,” said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited.

Spot gold rose as much as 1.2% to a record above $4,530 an ounce. Frictions in Venezuela, where the US has blockaded oil tankers and ramped up pressure on the government of Nicolás Maduro, have added to the precious metal’s haven appeal. In Africa, the US has launched a “powerful and deadly strike” against a terrorist group in Nigeria, according to a social-media post by President Donald Trump.
Spot silver for immediate delivery advanced for a fifth straight session, climbing as much as 4.5% to cross $75 an ounce for the first time. The white metal’s recent advance has been buoyed by speculative inflows and lingering supply dislocations across major trading hubs following a historic short squeeze in October.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the US currency’s strength, was down 0.8% for the week, its biggest drop since June. A weaker dollar is generally supportive of gold and silver prices.
Gold has gained around 70% this year and silver more than 150%, with both metals on track for their best annual performances since 1979. The scorching rally has been underpinned by elevated central-bank purchases, inflows to exchange-traded funds and three successive interest-rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. Lower borrowing costs are a tailwind for precious metals, which don’t pay interest, and traders are betting on more rate cuts in 2026.
Heavy ETF buying has been a major driver of the latest surge. Total holdings in gold-backed ETFs have risen every month this year except May, according to World Gold Council data, while holdings in State Street Corp.’s SPDR Gold Trust — the biggest precious-metals ETF — have risen by more than a fifth this year.
Silver’s rally has been even more spectacular than gold’s. London’s vaults have seen significant inflows since the squeeze in October, but much of the world’s available silver remains in New York as traders await the outcome of a US Commerce Department probe on whether critical minerals imports threaten national security. This could lead to tariffs or trade restrictions on the metal.
Gold rose 0.8% to $4,516.70 as of 9:25 a.m. in Singapore. Silver climbed 4.3% to $74.94. Platinum advanced 4.8%, approaching a high of $2,381.53 hit on Wednesday, which was the highest since Bloomberg began compiling data on the metal in 1987. Palladium was up 4%.

Ltd., the developer of Mumbai’s long-delayed Palais Royale tower, which is touted to be India’s tallest residential skyscraper once completed, has settled a dispute with an operational creditor that had moved the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking recovery of unpaid dues.
The order records that Saloni Sulakhe of law firm Dhaval Vussonji & Associates, appearing for Honest Shelters, handed over cheques worth₹3.75 crore to Interscape’s counsel in court.
The settlement removes one more legal hurdle for a project that has been mired in delays since its inception over 15 years ago. However, questions over timelines persist.
Honest Shelters paid₹705 crore to acquire the project in 2019 at an auction conducted by Indiabulls Housing Finance to recover dues from SRUIL. Under Honest Shelters, the completion deadline was extended three times, with the most recent target set for December 2024.
A year after that deadline passed, construction remains visibly incomplete, with cranes still perched atop the tower—a conspicuous marker of delay for Mumbai residents.
The project’s registration with the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) has lapsed, according to the regulator’s website.
Queries emailed to Honest Shelters remained unanswered. Sulakhe did not respond toMint’smessages.
Even so, prolonged delays and regulatory lapses have not deterred buyers at the very top end of the market.
In December 2024, the promoters of Metro Brands Ltd purchased five apartments on the 61st and 62nd floors of Palais Royale for a combined₹405 crore, making it the most expensive home purchase of 2024, according to data from Zapkey, a property registration data aggregation platform. More recently, in August this year, two apartments in the building changed hands for₹50–52 crore, Zapkey data shows.
Part of the project’s appeal lies in its scale and scarcity. Most apartments at Palais Royale have a carpet area of 4,755 sq. ft or 6,522 sq. ft, according to MahaRERA. The largest apartment spans 37,243 sq. ft. By contrast, nearly half of the new homes sold in Mumbai in 2024 had a carpet area of under 650 sq. ft, MahaRERA data shows.
Some of the project’s attractiveness is also likely stemming from its exclusivity and the advanced stage of construction, according to Pankaj Kapoor, managing director of real estate data and analytics firm Liases Foras.
“The construction of the building has reached an advanced stage so people may be taking comfort in that. It may not take 15 more years for the project to be completed, maybe one or two more years,” he said. Moreover, the project remains attractive to home buyers as such large apartments are not easily available in Mumbai.
“The project is also an exclusive address, so it is also a status symbol,” he said.

The B2B e-commerce unicorn is expanding its network of dark stores, aiming to offer two-to-four-hour deliveries in tier-2 and tier-3 towns, effectively bridging the gap between high-speed urban fulfillment and its traditional rural reach, founder and chief executive officer Sandeep Deshmukh toldMint.
“The emergence of quick commerce defined 2025 for us. Brands realized the correlation between speed of deliveries and customer experience and focused on rewriting their supply chains. We decided to focus on building last-mile capacities for these brands,” Deshmukh said in an interview.
The Pune-based company sees potential in this arm to account for 40-50% of its overall shipment volume by the end of next year, up from its current single-digit share, according to Deshmukh.
This strategy shift comes as quick commerce transcends from a mere convenience to become a critical distribution channel for merchants. For many companies, ‘instant gratification’ is no longer just a consumer demand but a competitive necessity to capture households willing to pay a premium for speed. By integrating rapid delivery, ElasticRun enables merchants to capitalize on impulse-driven, high-margin categories like food and home essentials, Deshmukh said.
Over the past two years, ElasticRun has implemented strategy changes to drive better unit economics in a tough macroeconomic landscape. It moved away from large national brands to regional consumer brands to build volume. Now, the company is working on improving adoption of its private labels, especially in tier-2 cities, where consumers are increasingly experimental.
“Our private brands are effective where large gaps in certain regions exist. A large part of the introduction of private brands was done last year itself. This year, we focused on deeper penetration of the existing portfolios,” Deshmukh noted. Private brands can command margins up to 25%, compared to 5% for other regional brands, improving revenue prospects, according to the executive.
Founded in 2016 by Deshmukh, Shitiz Bansal and Saurabh Nigam, ElasticRun supports FMCG and grocery companies with larger scale and a wider audience. It assists a host of clients including food, general merchandise and pharma companies to reach rural consumers through its nationwide network of over 900 warehouses and 50,000 on-ground partners.
It also enables banking institutions to extend financial services to consumers beyond urban geographies. Its key partners include Unibic, Lahori Zeera, CavinKare, and Bambino.
“Faster deliveries mean that the B2B customers can keep lower inventories at their end. This will make them more capital efficient, akin to how just-in-time revolutionized the automobile industry,” Madhur Singhal, managing partner (consumer and internet) at global consulting firm Praxis Global Alliance. However, such firms will need to maintain robust and standardized item masters and work on lowering manpower and vehicle-running costs to keep overall expenses in control, said Singhal.
Business-to-business marketplaces that are online-first and technology-enabled are expected to represent a market opportunity of $200 billion by 2030 from $20 billion in 2022, according to estimates by Bessemer Venture Partners.
ElasticRun’s operating revenue grew 10% year-on-year to₹2,653 crore in FY25, while narrowing net losses to₹145 crore from₹360 crore in the previous year. Deshmukh said increased efficiencies in logistics and focus on regional brands helped contain losses.
The current financial year is expected to take ElasticRun closer to profitability with quick commerce at the core of its strategy.
The company secured $330 million from SoftBank, Prosus and Goldman Sachs, among others, at a valuation of $1.5 billion, in February 2022.
“We have enough cash in the books, so fundraising isn’t a priority. We are just about a year away from delivering our best financial numbers since inception,” Deshmukh noted.

The National Startup Investment Guidance Fund, as well as the three vehicles covering the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta and the Greater Bay Area, began operating on Friday, according to Xinhua News Agency.
The national fund is backed by 100 billion yuan from the Ministry of Finance, financed through the issuance of ultra-long special sovereign bonds, Guo Fangming, a Finance Ministry official, said at a briefing on Friday.
The three regional funds are set up through the national fund’s equity stakes in limited partnerships and are each expected to eventually grow to more than 50 billion yuan, Huo Fupeng, chairman of the state fund, said at the same event.
China is ramping up its push for technological breakthroughs as competition with the US heats up in areas such as semiconductors. Tighter fiscal conditions — including rising debt risks and weaker revenue — have forced the government to be more disciplined about how it invests. At the same time, the rise of AI startup DeepSeek this year demonstrated the effectiveness of private capital.
“Emerging and future industries are still struggling with limited investment and insufficient inputs of other innovation factors,” Bai Jingyu, an official at the National Development and Reform Commission, said at the briefing.
“Addressing these gaps through the development of patient capital is the very purpose and mission of the guidance fund,” he said, adding that the state fund will follow market-based principles, with professional managers making investment decisions.
The NDRC first announced plans for the state fund in March, estimating it could drive 1 trillion yuan of investment from local funds and private capital.
The national fund will run for 20 years — with 10 years devoted to investment and another 10 to exits. This will help support long-term growth of companies and cultivate “little giants,” a term used for smaller firms aligned with the government’s tech priorities, as well as unicorns across industries, Bai said.
Seed and startup firms will account for at least 70% of the national fund’s investments, he said. The fund will target smaller companies with valuations of no more than 500 million yuan, and each deal will be capped at 50 million yuan.
Strategic emerging and future industries will be prioritized. Bai added that the three regional funds plan to invest in sectors such as integrated circuits, quantum technology, biomedicine, brain-computer interfaces and aerospace.

“The accused was no country bumpkin, but was possessed of not only an impeccable family and political pedigree, but of superior intelligence,” Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah said in an almost three-hour High Court summation Friday. He said Najib used Low, who is now on the run, as a “proxy or agent” in the affairs of 1MDB.
No verdict has yet been given in the more than two dozen charges against the 72-year-old Najib, with the court breaking shortly after noon in Kuala Lumpur time and scheduled to resume after 3 p.m. Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing and can appeal any guilty verdict.
The judge said prosecution witnesses were credible, also rejecting Najib’s “Arab donation” defense regarding millions of dollars placed in his bank account, purportedly by the Saudi royal family. The “cold hard facts” show Low’s presence and involvement in critical phases of 1MDB transactions and an “obvious proximity and relationship” with Najib, the judge said.
“The attempt by the accused to distance himself from Jho Low rang hollow in the light of the overwhelming evidence of these prosecution witnesses,” Sequerah said in the High Court. Suggestions that officials below Najib “knowingly conspired” against the then-prime minister would “stretch the imagination into the realms of pure fantasy.”
Najib is already serving time for crimes related to the collapse of 1MDB and on Monday lost a bid to serve the rest of his current six-year sentence at home. Friday’s ruling relates to 2018 charges against Najib in which he was accused of four counts of abuse of power and 21 counts of money laundering involving roughly 2.2 billion ringgit ($544 million) tied to 1MDB.
The state fund was set up during his premiership before collapsing in the sprawling, multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal, which has stretched from Singapore to Switzerland. Those ensnared in the affair included a Grammy-winning rapper and a high-profile banker, with global investigations revealing salacious details of Hollywood deals and parties with actor Leonardo DiCaprio. About $4.5 billion was allegedly lost in the scandal, which led to multiple probes across continents.
An adverse ruling would diminish the chances of a political comeback for Najib, although he retains significant influence in the United Malays National Organisation, which has campaigned for his release. UMNO’s secretary-general this week said it may be time to review its support for Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s government after the biggest member of the coalition, the Democratic Action Party, crowed over Najib’s recent legal loss.
Najib, whose father was Malaysia’s second prime minister, lost power in 2018 and has been in jail since 2022 for criminal breach of trust and abuse of power in connection with 1MDB. He had his original sentence halved to six years in early 2024 following royal intervention, and is due to be released in 2028.

His ongoing construction work at multiple homes in area aroused tension in the neighbourhood impacted by heavy noise and disruptions.
To settle down tensions, he gifted noise-cancelling headphones as a peace offering on this festive occasion,The New York Timesreported. The CEO of Meta was concerned about frustrated neighbours due to his expansion and modification drive of 11 homes in the Crescent Park locality.
Over the past 14 years, the 41-year-old billionaire bought nearly 11 homes on Edgewood Drive and Hamilton Avenue spent by shelling out more than $110 million. This residential area was once dominated by lawyers, business executives and Stanford University professors. However, Mark Zuckerberg commissioned activities have been defining the area over the years as it was not only the construction equipment that disrupted neighbours' peace, surveillance and frequent lavish parties have been driving them up the wall.
“Mark, Priscilla and their children have made Palo Alto their home for more than a decade. They value being members of the community and have taken a number of steps above and beyond any local requirements to avoid disruption in the neighbourhood,""Fortunequoted a spokesperson for Mark Zuckerberg as saying.
Besides the noise-cancelling headphones, Zuckerberg’s staff offered gifts to appease neighbours who complained about street blockages, debris and relentless noise as ongoing issues. Bottles of sparkling wine and boxes of Krispy Kreme doughnuts were among the several gifts reportedly offered by Zuckerberg.
Nearly eight years of continual construction activity and disruption surrounding Zuckerberg's expanding residential compound aroused discontent among neighbours. As per reports, the Meta Chief added 7,000 square feet of space underneath the residential compound. Residents describe these basements as “bunkers” or a “billionaire’s bat cave.""
Zuckerberg clashed with neighbours several times in the past. Facebook cofounder's real estate projects did not appeal to his neighbours as Palo Alto officials rejected a proposal in 2016 to demolish 4 homes and replace them with smaller houses and large basements. To avoid regulatory hurdles, Zuckerberg proceeded with his plans in a piecemeal fashion.
While the Palo Alto City Council and some residents describe it as city’s regulatory inaction and the exploitation of zoning loopholes, Zuckerberg’s building plans and land acquisitions have often provoked local controversy. Notably, he owns several other properties, including a 2,300-acre estate in Hawaii's Kauai, homes at Lake Tahoe and a mansion in Washington DC.

In 2025, India's insurance sector saw major shifts with the Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha Bill, 2025 enabling 100% FDI, fostering competition, alongside tech booms in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning for underwriting & claims, a surge in digital policy issuance, new products like usage-based & embedded insurance, and a significant push for enhanced regulatory governance and financial inclusion, driving massive capital inflow and market growth.
Mayank Bathwal, CEO, Aditya Birla Health Insurance, said, ""The year 2025 marked a clear inflection point for India's insurance ecosystem, with policy reform and digital progress beginning to translate into real consumer impact. The removal of GST improved affordability and access, while continued advancement on platforms such as the National Health Claims Exchange and Bima Sugam helped reduce friction from purchase, servicing to claims. Together, these developments strengthened confidence in the system and supported broader adoption.""
As announced by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, effective September 22, individual life and health insurance premiums are exempt from Goods and Services Tax , meaning the rate is 0%.
""Looking ahead to 2026, the direction is clear. Growth will be driven less by just expanding coverage and more by improving quality, consistency and trust. The next phase will focus on simpler products, faster and more predictable claims, and deeper engagement across the customer lifecycle. Insurers that prioritise transparency and long-term outcomes are poised to shape the future of the sector,"" he added.
Sumit Rai, MD & CEO, Edelweiss Life Insurance, said, ""2025 was an eventful year by all measures. India was tested on multiple fronts - a tariff war with the US, a brief yet tense military standoff with its neighbour , and a rupee under persistent pressure. Yet, the economy remained buoyant, with consumption staying robust, growth accelerating, and inflation falling to record lows - a credit to India's concerted policy efforts. It was also the year of the common man, as a cumulative 125-bps rate cut by the RBI, personal tax reforms in Budget FY26, and GST 2.0 reforms significantly improved the disposal income across households.""
""The life insurance industry mirrored this broader resilience, maintaining a strong growth trajectory amid a changing regulatory, and customer landscape. The GST exemption on life insurance products, which signalled the category as essential, boosted demand. Protection and non-participating products remained in favour as customers increasingly prioritised longer-term financial planning. The industry continued its customer awareness efforts under IRDAI's State Insurance Plan while also expanding distribution capabilities across the country,"" he said.
""The longer-term outlook for life insurance remains bullish, and the industry has been making significant strides year after year. Here are some trends likely to unfold in 2026 that continue this journey forward,"" he added.
Krishnan Ramachandran, MD & CEO, Niva Bupa Health Insurance, highlighting the surge in insurance premiums, said, ""Standalone health insurers recorded a robust 10.4% year-on-year growth in premiums, reaching₹3,622 crore , underscoring rising consumer demand and broader adoption of health insurance coverage. Total premium income is expected to reach₹3.21-3.24 lakh crore , followed by a further growth of 10.9% in FY27. Despite prevailing macroeconomic headwinds and cost pressures, steady improvements in insurance penetration and density indicate that the sector remains firmly aligned with the long-term vision of achieving Insurance for All by 2047.""
He also said the digital transformation moved into a more mature phase in 2025 for the insurance sector.
""Over 90% of retail policies are now estimated to be issued digitally across insurers. A growing share of health claims, 60-70% in urban markets, are processed through digital or cashless modes. AI-led claims triaging and fraud detection helped insurers reduce turnaround times and improve operational efficiency,"" he added.
Ramachandran also highlighted that distribution remained a key focus area as insurers worked to deepen penetration beyond metros. ""The industry today engages over 30 lakh licensed insurance intermediaries, with 2025 seeing heightened investments in advisor training, digital enablement and capability-building initiatives,"" he said.

In an interview with PTI, JB Park, President and CEO of Samsung Southwest Asia, said the South Korean giant is looking to deepen its manufacturing footprint in India and has applied under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for components to manufacture mobile phone displays in India.
Samsung runs its largest smartphone manufacturing facility in the world in Noida, which has evolved into a key export hub in recent years.
When asked about any possibility of IPO, Park said: ""No, we do not have any such plans as of now"".
While other South Korean peers like Hyundai Motor India and LG Electronics have tapped public markets to raise capital and strengthen their local footprint, Samsung places a preference on internal growth over market-funded expansion.
The strategy reflects a dual aim - leveraging AI to differentiate products in a crowded consumer electronics market while using financing solutions to boost sales amid slowing global demand.
Park said Samsung would be adequately funded through its capital requirement for investment in growth opportunities. Besides IPO, there are different means to acquire capital, such as institutional borrowings or through corporate bonds, among others.
""So, there are multiple options that you can get the working capital in place. So, IPO is not the plan for Samsung,"" he said.
By prioritising operational expansion over a public listing, Samsung is signalling confidence in long-term growth potential in India while maintaining tighter control over its strategic and financial direction.
Park said Samsung is looking to expand its interest-free finance scheme to home appliances. It currently sells smartphones on interest-free monthly EMIs, and the same is now being expanded to televisions and washing machines.
""More than 40 per cent of smartphones have been sold on Finance (Samsung EMI scheme),"" he said.
When asked what growth Samsung expects in this segment, Park said:"" This segment (Finance ) is growing 10 per cent every year"".
This scheme is a very big ""growth engine"" for Samsung India to grow in the rural markets of the north and northeast.
Park said AI will be a cornerstone for future Samsung products. Some of these will be showcased at the CES 2026, the world's largest consumer electronics and IT exhibition, in Las Vegas next month.
He said the company's AI appliances are entering a ""new turning point"", delivering smarter, more personalised experiences that enhance everyday living.
Samsung will also highlight innovations in TV technology at its ""The First Look"" event on January 4, 2026, in Las Vegas, he added.
At CES, Samsung will unveil upgrades across its AI appliance lineup, including the AirDresser, Laundry Combo, WindFree Pro Air Conditioner, and the flagship Jet Bot Steam Ultra robot vacuum.
The improvements combine AI-powered customisation with hardware enhancements to offer smarter fabric care, intuitive temperature control, and seamless cleaning experiences tailored to user lifestyles.
In the kitchen, Samsung will showcase the upgraded AI Refrigerator Family Hub, integrating Google Gemini for the first time. The new AI Vision improves on-device food recognition, expanding the types of fresh and processed foods the refrigerator can identify and manage, offering a more flexible and comprehensive kitchen experience.
Samsung will also expand its Micro RGB TV lineup, introducing the next generation of display technology aimed at setting new standards for premium home viewing.
Highlighting its global AI ambitions, Park noted that Samsung employs over 10,000 engineers in India across three R&D centres and a design centre, contributing to both local and global product innovations.

In a post on LinkedIn, Bengaluru-based entrepreneur Rohit Shroff said that he has paid around₹4 crore in taxes in terms of GST and income tax “to a country that looks at its most compliant contributors with suspicion by default”.
“In India, barely 4–5% of the population pays income tax. And yet, when notices are sent, clarifications raised, and scrutiny intensified, the same small group keeps getting targeted. The compliant. The ones already inside the system,” Shroff claimed.
“They hire teams to file GST every month, TDS every quarter, and income tax every year. Fighting the system costs more than submitting to it, so most don’t resist. They pay, respond, and move on,” Shroff wrote.
“At some point, a reasonable question emerges: what’s the point?” he asked, and immediately said that the answer lies in incentives.
Rohit Shroff, a partner at content marketing platform Aflog Group, claimed that India's tax system wins confidence of the majority and leaves behind the minority group that “thinks commercially, builds formally, and pays consistently”.
“People like us are spread thin across the country, politically insignificant, and therefore easy to ignore or extract from,” he said.
Rohit Shroff said that when Indians leave India, it's not because they hate the country.
“Indians don’t lack capability. They run large businesses across the UAE, the US, and much of the world. When they leave, it isn’t because they hate the country. It’s because the system doesn’t reward growth. It penalises it. It slows it down,” he said.
The Bengaluru entrepreneur said he was done with the “building in India” dream and would like to move out by 2026 to build his business elsewhere.
“It hurts to say this, but at some point self-preservation matters more than slogans. This isn’t about patriotism. It’s about reality. The system is flawed. There is no real development, and there is no genuine ease of doing business here.”
WhenLivemintreached out to Rohit Shroff, he clarified that his post was never about leaving India but the alleged ‘systemic’ tax abuse in the country.
“It’s not about the fact that I’ve paid taxes. But the systematic problem that - individuals and companies that pay taxes are looked at with suspicion. 4-5% of India pays tax, and it’s a systematic issue. 10% of turnovers get stuck in TDS. Yet we’re scrutinised with fines, notices etc The 95% that don’t file income tax, are the masses who in return get benefits because they’re the vote bank,” he toldLivemintover a LinkedIn conversation.
“It’s not about me leaving. It’s about me ranting about how unfair it feels for an entrepreneur,” Shroff said, adding, “It isn’t about me. It’s about systematic abuse. That’s why so many people came out and spoke up.”
“1000% agree with you. As an entrepreneur there are more ways the system can penalize/prosecute you than there are ways to reward you. Every business is always seen in suspicious light and it gets incredibly tough to justify time and again,” one person said.
“I moved back to India in 2019 believing the system had changed and would keep improving. I’m now certain it hasn’t. It’s designed to clip your wings, not help you fly, and eventually ambition must learn to leave,” another user agreed.
“This is absolute BS. I have been running a business for last 9 years. Not one IT notice. Not one GST notice. Why? Because I am fully compliant. I pay my taxes on time. I keep all records in order. I file returns on time. Leaving India is a personal choice and all the best to you for your new life. But do not blame the country for your decision,” a person commented.

Led by former TPG executive Vish Narain, Pulsar has backed several consumer-facing companies, including Biryani by Kilo and Blue Tokai, and earlier this year partnered with PJP Investments to bring Papa John’s Pizza to India.
Founded in 2004 by Ravichandar Ramaswamy, Nandhana Palace is among the more prominent Andhra-style restaurant chains, with multiple outlets across Bengaluru and Chennai. His daughters later joined the business with the aim of building what the company describes as a “tasty yet healthy food” brand that reflects the cuisine’s culture, environment and flavours.
In September,Mintreported that Nandhana was exploring a sale, part of a broader trend of restaurant chains and dessert brands considering exits amid rising investor interest. This has been supported by expectations of an imminent consumption boost following recent goods and services tax (GST) rate cuts, as well as a continued early-stage funding rush into consumer brands, leading to the emergence of several mid-sized players.
Together, these trends are fuelling more platform plays and inorganic growth opportunities, prompting brands in the₹100-crore revenue bracket to scout for buyers to unlock their next phase of scale. Beyond private equity and venture capital firms, strategic investors and large food companies are also actively pursuing acquisitions.
Meanwhile, the Nandhana group, which operates 27 outlets, is gradually expanding into other Indian cities. The company says it has grown consistently by offering a range of formats, from fine dining to indoor parties, according to its website.
Nandhana Foods Pvt. Ltd, which operates the chain, reported consolidated revenue of₹241 crore in FY24, up from₹188.3 crore a year earlier, and a profit of₹12.3 crore compared with₹3.9 crore in FY23, according to Ministry of Corporate Affairs filings sourced from Tofler.
(An earlier version of this mentioned that the fund-raising would provide for an exit to the promoters.)

Nasscom's statement comes at a time when the Donald Trump administration is replacing the random lottery system that has long selected H-1B visa beneficiaries. Now, a process will be implemented where employees with higher wages and better skills will be prioritised.
It warned that the shift could result into an aversion in international students from pursuing higher education in the US as the new system will restrict entry level job opportunities under its wage-weighted system thus weakening the talent base.
This could prove to be a negative situation for the US, weakening against the country's goals of strengthening competitiveness, driving innovation, and supporting higher education.
Nasscom further said that the new H-1B visa selection process raises important legal, economic, and operational concerns as it is a significant departure from the old lottery system.
Nasscom urged a phased implementation of the wage-weighted approach along with sufficient lead time, suggesting a delay till the FY28 lottery cycle. This would provide employers the necessary runway to adapt processes, ensure compliance, and maintain confidence in the stability of the US talent and investment environment.
The new framework puts the statutory focus on “specialty occupation” at risk by assigning multiple selection entries on the basis of Occupational and Employment Wage Statistics levels.
“Though the intent behind the proposed changes to promote high-skill employment, curb misuse, and protect US wages is well understood, a transparent, trusted visa framework is essential to maintaining the strength of the US technology ecosystem,” Nasscom said.
Nasscom said that the H-1B visa programme was not just about fulfilling labour needs, but also putting the US in a leadership position in industries that would define the 21st century.
“A balanced, consultative approach will be critical to ensuring that reforms strengthen rather than inadvertently weaken the innovation advantage and global competitiveness of the United States,” it said.
The Trump administration has introduced a number of changes to the H-1B visa programme that companies rely on to hire foreign talent as its scrutiny to curb immigration intensifies.
H-1B petitions at Level I and Level II wage bands frequently represent entry-level roles for graduates of US universities in science, engineering, and computing disciplines, forming a vital part of the STEM talent pipeline.

Global sales — including at subsidiaries Daihatsu Motor Co. and Hino Motors Ltd. — fell 1.9% in the period from a year earlier to 965,919 units, the Japanese carmaker said Thursday. Production shrank 3.4% to 934,001 vehicles.
Global automakers are facing greater uncertainty as they navigate an environment of trade tensions, regulatory changes and uncertain economic outlooks. Toyota’s results serve as a barometer for the industry’s struggle to balance strong long-term demand with short-term economic and policy headwinds.
Toyota and Lexus brand sales in China fell 12% in November, the company said, citing the end of trade-in subsidies in major cities as funds ran dry. The figures were released against a backdrop of diplomatic tensions that have been brewing between China and Japan since November, when Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi made remarks about Taiwan that angered Asia’s biggest economy. China responded by warning its citizens against traveling to Japan.
Toyota’s production in Thailand climbeded 15% last month and 9% in the US, but fell 14% in China, 9.7% in Japan and 7.9% in the UK.
The European Union’s decision this month to pull back an effective ban on combustion engines appeared to offer more flexibility to legacy carmakers seeking to mass-produce battery-powered cars. While Toyota and other Japanese carmakers, which pioneered gas-electric hybrid technology, already had an edge over legacy makers that remain dependent on pure-gasoline cars, the EU’s revision could give Chinese EVs the opening they’ve been waiting for.
Meanwhile, the company has been in President Donald Trump’s crosshairs as he prepared to level steep tariffs at cars and car parts imported to the US. Earlier this month, Trump said he was paving the way for Asia’s lightweight “kei” cars to be made and sold in the US, even though they currently don’t meet federal safety standards for new vehicles.
More recently, Toyota said its going to ship three models produced in American back to Japan, a gesture aimed at accommodating Trump’s wishes.

In an official statement on Wednesday, the regulator said it has decided to raise the simplified documentation threshold from₹5 lakh to₹10 lakh. The move is expected to significantly reduce procedural burden for investors seeking issuance of duplicate securities and make the overall process more efficient and investor-friendly.
It stated ""To facilitate ease of doing investment for investors, it has been decided to increase the threshold for simplified documentation from the current Rs. Five Lakhs to Rs. Ten Lakhs""
In addition, SEBI has undertaken several steps to rationalise documentation requirements. To simplify procedures, the regulator has prescribed a standardised Affidavit-cum-Indemnity bond for investors.
Further, documentation requirements for securities valued at more than₹10 lakh have been rationalised to reduce unnecessary paperwork.
SEBI has also decided to do away with the requirement of notarising the Affidavit-cum-Indemnity bond in cases involving securities valued at up to₹10,000.
According to SEBI, these measures are aimed at facilitating investment and ensuring faster restoration of investor rights in securities.
As duplicate securities issued will necessarily be in dematerialised form, the regulator said the steps will also contribute to increased dematerialisation across the market ecosystem.
The revised framework follows SEBI's earlier circular dated May 25, 2022. The earlier circular had prescribed the documentary and procedural requirements along with thresholds for the issuance of duplicate securities certificates.
To further simplify the process, SEBI reviewed the existing norms and introduced revised thresholds and a documentation framework.
SEBI has directed that all listed companies and RTAs (Registrar and Transfer Agents) shall process requests for issuance of duplicate securities strictly in accordance with the updated procedure. The provisions of the circular have come into force with immediate effect.
Importantly, the revised provisions will also apply to ongoing requests for the issuance of duplicate securities that are currently in process. This move is intended to ensure that investors already in the system also benefit from the simplified procedures.
However, SEBI clarified that if investors have already submitted certain documents under the earlier framework, listed companies and RTAs should not insist on re-submission of such documents in the new formats. (ANI)

That was traditionally delivered by humans: house managers, executive assistants, and trusted fixers who served the everyday world to the wealthy.
Now, a new set of startups is attempting to sculpt that quiet operating system into a product.
Consumer-facing players like Indulge and Pinch sell access via subscriptions, relying on salaried concierges backed by software. Legacy operators like LesConcierges are a pure B2B play, embedding concierge offerings for banks, brands, real estate developers, and loyalty programs.
Swiggy’s Crew, currently live in Bengaluru, Mumbai, and the NCR region, offers a broad menu of services: securing hard-to-get restaurant reservations, curating end-to-end travel itineraries, organizing birthday parties and gifts, handling airport transfers, and even assisting with tasks such as Aadhaar updates. Unlike Swiggy’s core food and grocery businesses, Crew is not built for speed or frequency. Instead, it targets users willing to pay for judgment, access, and follow-through—attributes traditionally associated with human concierges rather than apps.
This renewed interest has pulled in a new crop of startups, each angling for a piece of the pie at a different level of service.
Pinch Lifestyle, founded in 2021 and bootstrapped so far, is among the earlier attempts to bring concierge services to a consumer audience. The company positions itself as a horizontal orchestration layer, sitting above multiple service verticals. Its subscriptions range from₹999 for a tech-only plan to about₹1.5 lakh a month for high-touch support. Pinch currently services roughly 400 households, concentrated in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, with a smaller presence in cities such as Jodhpur, Bhubaneswar, Lucknow, and even parts of Jammu & Kashmir. The company is now preparing to raise $3-4 million as it looks to deepen its service stack, according to founder Nitin Srivastava.
Indulge Global, founded in 2022, and backed early by Nikhil Kamath of online brokerage Zerodha fame, operates further up the value chain. With annual subscriptions priced around₹4 lakh and a client base of roughly 300, Indulge has an uber-premium positioning. The company has also introduced an artificial intelligence-led plan at₹1 lakh a year, allowing customers to interact primarily with a trained AI agent supported by humans.
“Automation across finance, technology, and customer relationships is helping us become leaner over time,” said Karan Bhangay, founder of Indulge. Most of its clients are based in Bengaluru, though the company also serves customers in Surat and other cities, and is exploring custom in markets such as South Africa.
The distinction between concierge and adjacent categories like quick home services becomes clear when looking at demand dynamics. Platforms such as Snabbit and Pronto, both flush with funding, and recently-listed Urban Company’s InstaHelp are built to aggregate fast, uneven demand and create supply density around predictable spikes like Mumbai’s monsoons, festive seasons, or sudden household disruptions. Their defensibility sits in logistics optimisation and marketplace liquidity.
Personal concierge services, however, do not benefit from such demand peaks. Their demand is low-frequency, high-trust, and deeply contextual, shaped by lifestyle rather than urgency. “The model back then was largely reactive, a request comes in, you fulfill it,” Sikand said. “Today, concierge has evolved into anticipation and orchestration.” This shift also explains why players like LesConcierges resist commission-led monetization. “The moment concierge depends on commissions, it stops working for the client and starts working for the vendor,” she added.
Most concierge players, both online and offline, rely on full-time, salaried professionals rather than transactional labour that gig platforms employ. Some like Indulge go further by offering stock options to staff to hardcode long-term trust into the model.
Circumvention—customers bypassing the concierge once trusted vendors are identified—remains a frequently cited risk. Founders argue that this misunderstands the value proposition. “We are not a vertical solution. We are a horizontal solution,” said Pinch founder Srivastava. “Most on-demand services specialize in verticals; we operate as a horizontal layer above them.”
From a market perspective, the opportunity remains narrow but meaningful. India’s personal concierge market could grow into a $2–3 billion opportunity, according to consultancy Praxis Global Alliance. While HNIs and UHNIs form the core audience, the addressable market also includes affluent professionals, global Indians, and enterprises that use concierges as a strategic layer for retention and relationship management, said Madhur Singhal, Praxis's managing partner.
Fewer than 100,000 households today employ full-time house managers with another 100,000 relying on office EAs or informal support staff, per Praxis data. Concierge services could extend to 2-3% of households in the top 20 cities, with digital-first offerings reaching wealthy customers in smaller cities, added Singhal.
Personal concierge may not have platform characteristics yet but look an immensely profitable attempt to make life easier and softer for the rich—where luxury is defined by how little you have to think about how life plays to your tune.

Cut to now, the AI chipmaker has signed a $20 billion deal to buy assets from artificial intelligence startup Groq in an all-cash acquisition — its largest purchase to date, according to aCNBCreport.
Previosly, Nvidia had said it intended to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, but a formal deal has not been announced yet.
In its blog post, Groq said Nvidia will acquire its inference technology, for which both the companies have entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement. However, it did not disclose the transactional value of the deal.
Disruptive CEO Alexis Davis, who led Groq's latest financing round in September, told CNBC that the deal came together quickly.
Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assets just three months after the AI startup raised $750 million at a valuation of around $6.9 billion from investors including Blackrock, Neuberger Berman, Cisco, Samsung, Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr is a partner.
Alexis Davis, who has invested about half a billion since Groq's foundation in 2016, told CNBC that Nvidia is buying everything except the company's cloud business.
Groq in its blog post said “GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.”
It further said that Groq, even after the acquisition, will continue to operate as an independent company under finance officer Simon Edwards as CEO.
“We plan to integrate Groq’s low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads,” Huang wrote in the email, as per CNBC.
While Nvidia is adding Groq's senior leaders in its ranks and buying its IP, it is not “acquiring Groq as a company”, Huang said further.
The deal comes at a time when Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments as of October, up from around $13 billion in 2023. Other tech giants like Google, Meta and Amazon over the past few years have also made similar types of licensing deals to acquire top talent and technology from smaller AI firms.

The state-owned telecom operator also plans to terminate annual maintenance contracts (AMCs) with vendors such as Nokia and Chinese equipment maker ZTE for the 3G sites, according to two officials familiar with the matter and letters seen byMint.
The move comes as the state-run telecom operator focuses on its 4G network, having currently installed 97,481 4G towers across the country. “Keeping in view the above progress on 4G Network, circle heads are hereby authorized to shut down the 3G services wherever feasible in their areas,” the telecom operator said in a letter on 10 December to chief general managers of all circles. A copy of the letter was also marked to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which has rolled out indigenous 4G for the telecom operator.
Analysts believe the move could impact BSNL users who currently have 3G SIM cards and rely on the older handsets.
BSNL currently has 58,919 3G sites out of a total 229,278 tower sites across the country as of March end, according to its FY25 annual report. The company serves around 5,863 towns and cities under 3G, as per the report. As of September-end, BSNL has 92.2 million total mobile subscribers, according to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. Of these, 22 million users are on 4G, while the remaining users are on 2G and 3G, according to a government release in September. Notably, a large number of the remaining users are on 2G, which remains BSNL's mainstay and is expected to be maintained alongside newer technologies.
One of the reasons for BSNL to move away from 3G is to use the existing 2100 MHz spectrum completely for 4G. The company only has 10 MHz spectrum in the band, which supports better capacity, meaning it helps carry more data and more users at higher speeds, especially in towns and cities. “This will help BSNL in saving expenditure towards power consumption and AMC (annual maintenance cost) expenses being incurred on 3G Network,” BSNL said in the letter.
In a separate letter dated 10 December, the company instructed all circle heads to issue notices to vendors operating in their circles for the termination of annual maintenance agreements pertaining to 3G sites and radio network controller (RNC) equipment.
Queries emailed to BSNL chairman and managing director Robert Ravi did not elicit any response until press time.
Parag Kar, an independenttelecom sector analyst,said, “The shutdown of 3G will impact existing BSNL users, who will need to upgrade to 4G handsets or fall back on 2G. For BSNL, stabilizing its 4G network is critical and requires the full 10 MHz spectrum in the 2100 MHz band, of which only 5 MHz is currently available as the rest remains locked in legacy 3G,” he said.
Kar noted that BSNL’s 4G deployment in the 700 MHz band offers limited benefit, as many legacy devices do not support it. “Most users therefore rely on 2100 MHz for 4G, where 5 MHz is insufficient to deliver meaningful throughput, making the shutdown of 3G in this band essential to improve user experience and network performance,” he added.
The government has asked BSNL executives to closely monitor the operating expenditure, ensure a reduction, and proactively implement cost optimization measures in the respective circles to improve the profitability of the company.
“From a technology lifecycle perspective, 3G is already sunset in many global markets. However, any decision to shut down 3G should be calibrated and region-specific, taking into account actual 4G coverage, network stability, and the profile of users still dependent on 3G services, or not,” said Murtuza Kachwala, managing director of Protiviti Member Firm for India.
According to Kachwala, it is important for BSNL to manage the transition carefully through phased shutdowns, clear communication, and possibly device or tariff support to minimize inconvenience to customers.
In the July-September quarter, BSNL’s network operating expenses were at₹1,488 crore, up 2.5% year-on-year (y-o-y). The network operating expenses, which include repair and maintenance work, constituted 29% of BSNL’s₹5,167 crore revenue in the quarter.

Carlyle-backed Hexaware, which re-entered Indian bourses in February, has argued that the inventions at the centre of the dispute amount to abstract ideas rather than genuine technological innovations.
“For more than 150 years, the Supreme Court has held that patents cannot protect laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas because these are the basic tools of scientific and technological work,” read a 12 December Hexaware court filing in support of its plea to dismiss Natsoft’s case.
“Using ‘computers to compute’ is not a patent-eligible ‘invention’,” read the filing.
Hexaware filed a motion to dismiss Natsoft’s case on 12 December, followed by a separate filing on 19 December seeking to halt discovery pending the court’s decision.Minthas seen copies of both filings.
Natsoft is represented by Maxson Mago & Macaulay, LLP, and Shelhoff Canfield & Chin LLC. Hexaware is represented by Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker LLP.
In its submissions, New Jersey-based Hexaware said Natsoft’s complaint merely describes the software development life cycle (SDLC), a standard process for creating software that includes planning, designing, developing, and maintaining software tools.
“The Complaint’s descriptions regarding the Accused Products comprise statements allegedly made publicly by Hexaware that do no more than describe the various stages of the SDLC (software development life cycle) as implemented for modernizing legacy code. These statements mimic the generic and vague elements of the asserted claims,” said Hexaware.
For Hexaware, which follows a January-December fiscal year, damages of $500 million would amount to nearly four times its net profit of₹1,174 crore ($132 million) in the last fiscal year. The company ended the year with revenue of $1.43 billion, up 14% year-on-year.
Natsoft is a New Jersey-based IT services company with about 2,000 associates, providing back-end IT services and managing customer support for roughly 500 clients globally.
In its filings, Hexaware said all nine patents asserted by Natsoft are invalid, arguing that they cover the “abstract idea” of automatically generating computer code. Hexaware said this activity has traditionally been a manual process and does not constitute a patentable invention.
Hexaware also contended that Natsoft failed to provide sufficient detail on how Hexaware’s products allegedly infringed its patents.
“Plaintiffs’ Complaint does not identify or particularize any alleged confidential information, a basis for any reasonable expectancy of profit, or anything unjust, and, therefore, these claims fail as well,” read the filing.
Natsoft, in its own submissions, stated that its affiliate invested $100 million in developing the software products it alleges were stolen and marketed by Hexaware. It also accused Hexaware of knowingly advertising three software products—RapidX, Tensai/ATOP, and Amaze—based on those inventions.
Hexaware has asked the court to halt further investigation while the motion to dismiss is decided, citing cost concerns.
“A stay of discovery pending the decision on the motion to dismiss will conserve judicial and party resources and allow this case to proceed, if at all, on a clear and properly framed set of claims. Plaintiffs will suffer no cognizable prejudice from such a stay, and both parties may avoid significant and potentially unrecoverable costs defending claims that may be dismissed or substantially narrowed,” said the 19 December filing.
The lawsuit comes at a challenging time for Hexaware. The company slipped two places in Indian IT’s pecking order last year and has been facing lower revenue and project delays from two of its top accounts, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
An industry expert said the dispute reflects a broader shift in software development practices.
“From an industry perspective, this case also reflects a broader tension around legacy software patents being tested against modern AI and automation-led development practices,” said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a Massachusetts-based research firm.
As automation tools gain traction in the tech services industry, a growing share of software modernization work is being automated, reducing employee billings and overall revenue. Companies, as a result, are becoming increasingly protective of their inventions as they seek to defend their turf against peers.

In February 2020, American Airlines announced that it would connect Seattle with Bengaluru starting in October that year. Within weeks, almost the entire world went into a lockdown. In the midst of the pandemic, United Airlines announced its longest flight yet between San Francisco and Bengaluru, starting in 2021. Both never took off; instead, Air India, then a government-owned airline, launched flights between the two IT hubs in January 2021 under the air bubble agreement. The route was suspended in early 2022, but the Russia-Ukraine war continued, and seeing American carriers stay away from the Russian airspace, along with additional airworthy planes, Air India relaunched the route.
For the 12 months ending September, a little under 1,50,000 passengers flew between the two cities (both ways included). Air India offers thrice-a-week service on this route currently, with 344 seats on offer across First (four), Business (35 seats) and Economy (305 seats) per flight. Air India carried close to 14,000 passengers (two way) on this route in the July-September quarter, and over 63,000 passengers for 12 months ending September 2025, or about 43% of the total traffic, with the rest opting for one-stop options.
At the heart of the issue is the lack of planes. Bengaluru-San Francisco is one of the longest routes in the world, with B777-200LR being the aircraft of choice when the route started. Air India had three legacy B777-200LRs in its fleet and was augmented with five more former Delta Air Lines B777-200LRs. All legacy ones and two former Delta planes are not out of the fleet. The airline could not extend the leases for the same. The former Delta planes were a favourite with the passengers as they had significantly better interiors and experience as compared to the legacy Air India B777s. After April 2025, when Pakistani airspace is closed for Indian operators, Air India has been taking a technical stop (to refuel) for flights to San Francisco. Currently, the Bengaluru-San Francisco flight operates via Delhi, while the return takes a halt in Kolkata. Not only does this add time, taking away the benefit of a non-stop flight, but it also makes it less attractive for passengers and costlier for the airline as it involves one more landing and take-off.
The Bengaluru-San Francisco route is a hit among IT professionals and VFR traffic (Visiting Friends and Relatives) since old parents visiting families in the Bay Area can effortlessly fly without transferring at major hubs in Europe, which is the other way of reaching San Francisco.
This opens up opportunities for carriers from Europe, like British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa, Air France, and KLM, which have flights to Bengaluru and operations to San Francisco with connections at their hubs in Europe. This also helps Emirates and Qatar Airways, which are considered better hubs to transfer over European ones by many passengers. Lufthansa has augmented capacity to Bengaluru post-pandemic with flights from Munich.
Pakistan has been extending the airspace closure for one month at a time. One wonders if it would be available anytime soon. With the expansion plan of carriers from India, especially Air India being strong, will Indian carriers have to invest in something similar to Project Sunrise, which Qantas had undertaken to ensure it can fly non-stop from Sydney and Melbourne to points in Europe and the UK. It comes at a cost, and the passengers should then be able to afford the pricing, which gets passed on to the end consumer.
All eyes are now on the Russia-Ukraine war. If it stops soon, it will give United an opportunity to fly to Bengaluru, which it cannot do without using the Russian airspace or taking a stop. If that happens, a market that Air India built will be handed out on a platter.

The transaction will help Haier Group shed stake to comply with Indian investment rules for Chinese companies besides, as pointed out in a statement by the companies, boost its local manufacturing capacity in the country.
Warburg Pincus said in a response toMintit was not sharing any more details than in the press statement. Emails sent to Bharti Enterprises and Haier for comments did not receive a response until press time.
The deal was necessitated by the need for Chinese companies to be compliant with India government's Press Note 3, sources had toldMintearlier. According to rules in the press note, an entity of a country sharing land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an investment is an entity of such country sharing border can invest only under government route or prior approval.
""Haier, being a Chinese business, needed a local partner to be in the India market as a long-term player,"" explained a person directly aware of the deal. “Bharti Enterprises and Warburg coming in to Haier adds a lot of legitimacy to its business operations in India and the firm believes the government will also look at it favourably.”
Bharti-owned telco, Bharti Airtel is India's third most valuable listed company by market capitalization.
For Chinese firms, there are very few opportunities in India to get a strategic partner in a financial investment capacity. ""The last time we saw something this big happen was the MG-JSW deal,"" this person added. In March 2024, a clutch of Indian investors, led by billionaire Sajjan Jindal’s conglomerate, picked up 51% of MG Motor India to create JSW MG Motor India Pvt. Ltd. China’s SAIC Motor Corp. until then owned 100% in the maker of Hector and Windsor cars. Deal details were not disclosed then.
Through this deal, Bharti Enterprises and Warburg Pincus plan to deepen local sourcing capabilities while expanding manufacturing capacities in the country in an effort to innovate products and boost market penetration of Haier India. “The new capital infusion will also enhance Haier India’s competitiveness across the entire value chain,” the companies said in the statement.
Established in 2003 in India, the ownership of Haier Appliances India Pvt. Ltd (Haier India), is routed through Haier Singapore Investment Holding Pte. Ltd,Mintreported earlier. It sells refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, LED TVs, water heaters, deep freezers, and microwave ovens to kitchen appliances in the country. It has two manufacturing facilities in Pune and Greater Noida. It is the third largest consumer durables maker in India after LG and Samsung.
Over the past seven years, Haier India has achieved a CAGR of approximately 25% in India, fueled by the performance across product segments of the brand and geographies.
Mittal through investment companies has shed ""Bharti Airtel stake worth around $4 billion in the last 12 months, and has been using proceeds from the share sale to diversify his holdings,” a third person said on the condition of anonymity.
The majority of proceeds from the share sale in the Indian telco was put into acquiring part of the 24.5% stake in BT Group Plc, a telecom services player, a part of the funds will now be used to fund the Haier deal, this person added.
Bharti Enterprises controls stakes in Bharti Airtel and infrastructure play Indus Towers Ltd in the telecom space. It also owns stake in Bharti AXA Life Insurance Co, Bharti Real Estate, and PizzaExpress operator Gourmet Investments Pvt. Ltd, besides others investments.

Data analysed by equity management platform Qapita shows that 16 startups went for mainboard IPO this year, enabling employees to monetise Esops worth a cumulative $1 billion. This compares with $807 million unlocked across 10 startups in 2024 and just $39 million across four startups in 2023.
The listings converted years of option grants and vesting into tangible wealth for startup employees across levels.
The 2025 data shows Esops in private companies have moved from ""paper wealth"" to a proven, large‑scale monetization channel, said Tanmay Shah, Qapita’s head of liquidity programs. ""10,000 employees (in private companies) saw liquidity via buybacks and many more via IPO exits, despite a funding‑winter backdrop.”
This points to a maturing market where employee equity is now part of the mainstream startup value proposition, and secondary liquidity through buybacks and IPOs is being institutionalized rather than treated as ad‑hoc rewards, he added.
Typically, Esop buybacks allow startups to reward and retain employees while offering senior management a chance to book profits at a later stage, especially during public listings. This year, however, buybacks played a smaller role as public markets emerged as the most attractive exit route for startup talent.
The 21 buyback programmes announced in 2025 unlocked $194 million in employee wealth, lower than $252 million across 26 buybacks in 2024 and well below the 2021 peak of $399 million across 37 programmes during the pandemic funding boom.
In 2023, 19 buyback programmes generated $825 million of liquidity, but this figure included an adjusted value of nearly $700 million linked to Flipkart and PhonePe’s 2022 corporate restructuring. Excluding that outlier, liquidity in 2023 was only $125 million, reflecting continued weakness in private funding markets, Qapita’s data showed.
In contrast, the 16 new-age startups that listed this year raised more than₹41,000 crore via IPOs, reinforcing public markets as the dominant liquidity avenue for Esop holders. In 2024, 13 startups raised around₹29,000 crore via IPOs, including three SME listings.
Despite the muted number of buybacks over the years, Shah said buybacks will continue to matter for growth-stage companies that are pacing their way to the public markets, or choosing to stay private longer, offering periodic liquidity to employees and signalling confidence in long-term value creation.
“As the IPO pipeline remains healthy (20+ startups reported to be preparing for listings) and several unicorns/soonicorns are pre‑IPO, the Esop exercises at IPO or pre-IPO is expected to stay the most visible Esop monetisation route, especially for larger, late‑stage tech companies where listings can unlock outsized value for broad employee pools in a single event,” he explained.
Esops grant company shares to employees based on the length of their employment as part of their compensation package. Shares vest over a period, usually around four years.
While Esops enable a startup to preserve liquidity, they also serve as a tool to reward employees for their loyalty and retain talent.
“Shares held by employees pursuant to ESOPs are not subject to statutory lock-in post IPO, and the bullish public market valuation makes it more attractive for employees to sell such shares upon listing,” said Oishik Bagchi, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.
In contrast, secondary buyback of ESOP shares in the unlisted space could be uncertain as the company controls the pricing, quantum, eligibility, and other factors, with the compliance process resting entirely with them, Bagchi said.
At least 30 companies, including Milky Mist Dairy Food, Curefoods India, Shiprocket, Shadowfax Technologies and Gaja Capital, have received regulatory approvals in recent months, setting the stage for potential listings next year.
Overall, companies raised more than $21 billion through IPOs in 2025, a record both in terms of capital raised and the number of filings, Mint reported earlier citing data from Prime Database.
Marquee listings this year also included JSW Cement, Tata Capital, LG Electronics India, HDB Financial Services, Orkla India and Hexaware Technologies.
Amid this healthy momentum, industry experts expect Esops to remain a key hiring tool for attracting talent, particularly in the new economy, as it provides employees the opportunity to create wealth through the growth and increased valuation of the company from the successive rounds of capital raise.
They help startups close talent gaps with larger firms in hiring by offering a credible upside story, Shah said, noting that recent IPO- and buyback-led cash outcomes have strengthened employee confidence that equity can deliver meaningful long-term rewards.
Esops also aid retention through multi-year vesting schedules, clearer communication on liquidity events and performance-linked top-ups that encourage employees to stay invested in a company’s long-term journey rather than chase short-term salary hikes.

European private equity firm Vitruvian Partners is evaluating the deal as a lead investor, while others such as ChrysCapital, Warburg Pincus and Permira have held preliminary discussions, the people told Mint.
The proposed transaction is expected to be largely secondary, with a smaller primary component, and could result in a partial exit for early backer Peak XV Partners.
“The discussions have been underway for five to six months, but the final closure is subject to multiple legal, tax and commercial conditions,” the person said, adding that it is likely to close in March-April to account for tax considerations.
If concluded, the proposed round could value K-12 Techno at around $800–900 million, a sharp increase from its last funding of $500-600 million, according to one of the people cited above.
The talks come amid renewed private equity interest in K-12 education, with investors increasingly favouring platform-led consolidation over backing individual school assets, industry experts said.
Investors are “actively scouting for aggregator platforms that can standardise curriculum, procurement and teacher training across multiple cities,” said Anupam Shukla, partner at law firm Pioneer Legal. Such platforms also make regulatory compliance easier, including adherence to Right to Education (RTE) norms and state-level fee regulations, he added.
Cash-generating education segments like school chains and technology-led models have seen investors return selectively after funding in the sector slowed sharply following the post-covid surge.
Given the fragmented nature of India’s school market, scalability through consolidation is seen as more efficient than owning single assets, Shukla said, noting that private equity investments in education typically flow through for-profit service companies that support schools operated by non-profit trusts.
K-12 Techno has seen a series of secondary transactions over the past two years. In September 2023, Kedaara Capital invested close to $150 million to buy a stake from Peak XV Partners, valuing the company at about $450–460 million.
In May 2024, Venturi Partners acquired a 5.12% stake for $27 million from Navneet Education, valuing the company at $500-600 million, while Navneet retained a 14–15% stake.
In December last year, the company raised $40 million from Kenro Capital at a similar valuation,Minthad reported.
The company was founded in 2010 by M. Venkatanarayana, M.S.C. Srikanth and Jai Dcosta. Venkatanarayana and Srikanth exited the company in 2016.
K-12 Techno runs a diversified education platform spanning school management and early learning. The company's core business is Orchids The International School. It also runs a school partnership model under K-12 Techno, early-learning brands SparkleBox and SparkleBox School, and other verticals such as Plufo and Let’s Eduvate.
According to a report published by rating agency Icra in March, the company logged operating revenue of₹435 crore in FY24, with operating margins improving to 15.6%. Margins expanded further to around 21.7% in the first nine months of FY25, even as revenues are expected to moderate to about₹400 crore due to a lower contribution from the B2B segment.
K-12 Techno competes with the likes of Lead School, Classplus and others in the education technology space.
The India school market size reached $54.2 billion in 2024 and is expected to hit $135.6 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2% during 2025-2033, market research company IMARC Group said.

Goudet, through investment vehicle Platin SARL, has taken a 5% stake in the Penfolds owner, according to an exchange filing on Wednesday. The Australian firm has a market capitalization of about A$4.3 billion ($2.8 billion). Treasury shares were up 6% at A$5.33 as of 1:40 p.m. in Sydney.
The investment comes after Treasury’s shares slumped to the lowest level in more than a decade earlier this month, as the firm grapples with flagging demand in key markets including the US and China. The vintner has canceled a A$200 million stock buyback and said it’s reviewing planned capital investments.
The company last week announced asset sales and said it would pursue A$100 million in annual cost cuts over the next two to three years under new Chief Executive Officer Sam Fischer.
Treasury has warned of weakness in both the US and China, compounded by a distributor transition in California and Beijing’s crackdown on boozy government banquets. It also announced a near A$690 million write-down of its US business, underscoring the challenges facing the winemaker even as a high-profile investor steps in.
Goudet is a co-founder of private investment firm JAB Holdings BV, which controls or holds stakes in global consumer brands including Dr Pepper, Krispy Kreme and Panera Brands. He stepped down as JAB’s CEO after 12 years and became senior investment advisor to the firm early last year.

The company aims to scale up its rare earth recovery and recycling capacity in India to 100 tonne per day, from the current 1 tonne.
""Our (lithium ion) battery recycling capacity will increase to almost 300,000 tonne per annum from the current 17,000 tonne, almost 15 times the expansion,"" he said.
Attero currently recovers rare earth elements from used permanent magnets and exports its recycled rare earth products. It recovers minerals such as neodymium and seramium that find end use in the permanent magnets in automotive and defence sectors.
At a time when India is exploring ways to become self-reliant in critical minerals used in batteries, renewable energy components, defence and IT equipment, recycling of e-waste is increasingly seen as a major way to source these materials.
India generates over 3.8 million tonne of e-waste annually. While a significant portion still moves through informal routes, the share of formal processing is steadily increasing due to the enforcement of extended producer responsibility (EPR) and stricter compliance norms.
Gupta expects domestic demand to pick up as new capacities come up under the recently announced₹7,800 crore magnet manufacturing scheme of the heavy industries ministry.
The company currently recycles rare earth elements at its Roorkee plant. It recently invested around₹150 crore to expand its recycling and R&D network. It launched new e-waste recycling plants in Pune, Bengaluru and Faridabad, a copper recycling plant in Reengus, Rajasthan and a strengthened R&D centre of excellence in Greater Noida.
The three new e-waste plants have a capacity of 25,000 tonnes per annum each, adding 75,000 tonnes of fresh e-waste processing capacity. The copper recycling unit in Rajasthan adds another 25,000 tonnes, bringing total planned capacity additions to 100,000 tonnes per annum.
These facilities will support better feedstock availability for Attero’s business units, including Selsmart and MetalMandi, reduce long-distance movement of waste and improve access to formal recycling for India’s high-consumption markets, according to a company statement.
Speaking about Attero's fundraising plans, the CEO said it is looking at a public listing in the next two to three years. ""There's enough (capital) and more interest from the market. From an IPO angle, we are obviously looking at a public listing in the next two to three years.""
“We are a profitable company and we are growing 100% year-on-year and our profit margins are also increasing year on year. Last year, we did roughly around₹1,000 crores in revenue. In FY24, we did roughly around₹440 crores in revenue. In FY23, we did roughly around₹280 crores,” Gupta said.
""Our profit margin, will continue to improve going forward. So from a capital structure perspective, we obviously continue to look at debt, we continue to look at equity, and we will raise capital as and when we feel there's a need to do that,"" he said.
Under the₹34,300 crore National Critical Mineral Mission launched in January, the Centre is promoting domestic recycling and refining to reduce reliance on China, which dominates over 90% of global critical mineral processing. The mines ministry is also preparing a₹1,500 crore scheme to support critical mineral refining.
China accounts for 68.6% of global rare earth mining, followed by the US at 12.3%. These percentages are much higher than their corresponding shares in reserves (40% and 1.64%, respectively). India’s share in global reserves is at 6.27% but its share in mining is limited to 0.83%.
Although India has opened up rare earth mining in the country, it will take about four to five years for these mines to commence commercial operations. Till then, recycling would be the key domestic source.
Alekhya Datta, director, electricity and renewables division, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), said: ""Recyclers must plan for phased ramp-up, interim offtake options, and working-capital buffers rather than assuming immediate commercial acceptance."" According to experts, companies in rare earth refining space may also have to look at foreign collaboration for technology as the rare earth ecosystem in India is yet to develop.

Pune-based Bajaj Auto will look to discontinue smaller brands under KTM, rejig core operations and unlock synergies between the supply chains of Bajaj and KTM to reduce costs, according to management commentary during the earnings call and meetings with analysts.
“After the KTM acquisition, Bajaj Auto would now focus on the restructuring of the core operations. They would also look to leverage synergy benefits in manufacturing operations, the supply chain, and the distribution network,” analysts at Motilal Oswal wrote in a 15 December note after meeting Bajaj Auto's leadership team.
Bajaj Auto acquired struggling motorcycle maker KTM for about €800 million. The management told analysts that the company is looking to exit the bicycle, cars and other smaller brands to focus on the KTM and Husqvarna motorcycles. Efforts will begin in earnest in the first half of calendar year 2026, the company said. KTM has a sports car brand KTM X-Bow.
While its main plant is in Austria, KTM has assembly facilities in China, Brazil and the Philippines, among others. In 2023, all the facilities produced 380,000 bikes. In India, the Bajaj-owned Chakan plant produces vehicles for the local market and exports.
“Management has indicated that 1HCY26 will be the year of consolidation/restructuring, and from 2HCY26, one can observe operational benefits of these measures,” the Motilal Oswalanalysts wrote in the note.
Bajaj Auto’s top officials said in a 7 November earnings call that the company plans to overhaul KTM’s operations.
“It is fair to assume that as we (Bajaj Auto) get involved, once the change of control happens over the next couple of weeks, we will then put in place a full-fledged program for the operational turnaround that straddles pretty much the front-end and the back-end including rationalization,” Rakesh Sharma, executive director at Bajaj Auto, told analysts during the July-September earnings call.
Following a slowdown in the European premium motorcycle market, KTM filed for insolvency and applied for judicial restructuring proceedings in November 2024.
The company’s inventory spiked as sales declined, keeping its capacity unused. In 2024, KTM sold 292,497 motorcycles, a 21% decrease from the 372,511 units sold in the previous year. To fuel its expansion, the company had also taken on total debt of more than $500 million. As income declined, KTM found itself in a difficult position, ultimately leading to a bankruptcy filing.
Bajaj Auto, which operated the company a joint venture with Pierer Mobility AG since 2007, acquired it in May. Bajaj will infuse €600 million into the company through debt funding, while €200 million has already been invested since FY2024, taking the total amount of the deal to €800 million (₹7,778 crore).
Strengthening performance in the international market was one of the stated reasons for Bajaj taking full control of KTM in November. According to Bajaj's own plans and independent analysts, the initial turnaround plan will focus on paring costs and stablizing KTM’s balance sheet, given its high debt.
Cost reductions in the initial phases always help, as has been the case in the past but Bajaj Auto will need a thorough analysis of the situation at KTM, said Subhabrata Sengupta, partner at Avalon Consulting.
""Ultimately, it will all boil down to product. What will help the company is a root-cause analysis of whether KTM products are working with consumers or not. A market for premium motorcycles is always there, but it needs to be understood clearly why certain products did not work,” Sengupta said. “In the short term, cost reduction will help. However, in the long term, the strategy will have to focus on getting the products right.""
While Bajaj has not clearly laid out the product plan for KTM globally, Sharma said during the earnings call that Bajaj is working with Austrian motorcycle maker to under how it can benefit from aspirations of consumers to move towards more premium products after the goods and services tax cuts in September.
The KTM brand revival would help eliminate the drag from a loss-making business, according to Mumuksh Mandlesha, research analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.
“Stake in KTM has been a small contribution to Bajaj’s valuation over the years. KTM can boost its margins from the business, but it will take time, perhaps maybe at least two years, before meaningful gains are seen,” said Mandlesha. “But a drag on overall financial performance will reduce after the full revival.”
The turnaround plan comes when Bajaj Auto’s domestic sales growth has slowed. According to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), its market share slipped from 12% in April-November of 2024 to 11% in the same period of 2025.
Between April and November, Bajaj Auto’s two-wheeler sales in the domestic market fell 5% from a year ago to 1.59 million units. The overall bike and scooter market grew 3% to 14.3 million units during the period.
The company is losing in the mass segment below 125cc as Honda gains. According to Siam data, sales of Bajaj in 110cc to 125cc range motorcycles fell by 13% to 561,328 units. In the 75cc to 110cc segment, its sales dropped 12% to 335,894 units.
""Management targets to recover the lost share in domestic motorcycles on the back of a few new launches, which include the new 125cc commute motorcycle, which is likely to be launched in FY27E, three Pulsar variant launches in Dec ’25, Mar ’26, and May ’26, andintervention in the Dominar brand,"" analysts at Motilal Oswal said.
However, domestic challenges have yet to hit the balance sheet, as Bajaj Auto posted a 53% rise in net profit to₹2,122 crore in Q2 (July–September). Its domestic underperformance has been outweighed by exports, which grew 14% in the April to November period to 1.24 million units.

“Mr. Nygard failed to provide any evidence whether the statements made by Mr. Nygard had any truth,” Richard G. Latin, a state court judge in Manhattan, wrote in a decision on Monday resolving the issue in Bacon’s favor.
The ruling is the latest turn in a bitter, years-long feud between the two men, formerly next-door neighbors in the Bahamas’ exclusive Lyford Cay community, involving more than a dozen suits in New York, London and the Bahamas. In the defamation suit, Bacon claimed that Nygard and his companies orchestrated a smear campaign of “outrageous lies” in online videos and public statements.
Peter Sverd, who represents Nygard in the defamation case, said his client is “disappointed in the ruling” and plans to appeal.
Nygard, 84, is serving an 11-year prison sentence in Canada for sexual assault. He faces additional charges in Canada and a US indictment in New York for racketeering and sex trafficking.
US prosecutors claim Nygard used the resources of his company, Nygard International Partnership, to help him control women through the use of surveillance and physical restraint. Nygard hosted “pamper parties” in California and in the Bahamas, where guests were plied with food, drinks and spa treatments, according the indictment.
A court-appointed referee awarded Bacon, 69, $203 million in damages against Nygard in 2023, citing “overwhelming” evidence of a “deliberate plan by Nygard to personally and professionally destroy Bacon.” That award was reversed on appeal the following year when an appeals court ruled that Nygard hadn’t properly been served court papers while in prison.
Judge Latin is likely to set a hearing to determine the amount of damages due to Bacon.
In his ruling, Latin found Nygard liable for a type of defamation which includes false statements accusing someone of a serious crime or that injure the person in his business or profession. As a result, Bacon will not have to prove specific damage to his reputation or business to win a money judgment.
The case is Bacon v. Nygard, 150400/2015, NY State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).

The move is the latest in a series of examples of the federal government withholding funds from states and cities led by Democrats. The announcement comes as Republicans ramp up investigations into alleged fraud in Minnesota, including some groups that received COVID-era emergency loans.
President Donald Trump and his administration recently have focused attention on the cases of alleged fraud, criticizing Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, claiming he mishandled the administration of government funds. Trump last month announced he was revoking temporary protected status for Somali refugees living in the state, citing accusations Somalis were involved in fraud.
SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced she would halt $5.5 million in small business funding going to the state “pending further review” in a post on X on Tuesday.
“With dozens of investigations underway, the conclusion is unavoidable: Minnesota cannot be trusted to administer federal tax dollars,” she said in the post, which didn’t provide further details on what funds would be halted.
Claire Lancaster, a spokesperson for Walz, blasted the Trump administration for seeking to blame the Minnesota governor rather than addressing weaknesses in federal programs.
“While the Governor has been fighting fraud, the Trump administration has spent the past month sending dozens of letters, statements, and social media posts filled with threats to withhold funding and investigate the state,” Lancaster said in a statement. She said the alleged frauds “exposed failures within federal systems” that “are administered and overseen by the federal government and which have nothing to do with the Walz Administration.”
The House Small Business Committee on Tuesday sent a letter to Loeffler requesting information about federal pandemic relief funds flowing to entities in Minnesota connected to the fraud scandal.
The Minnesota nonprofit Feeding Our Future was at the center of the largest pandemic relief fraud charged in US history, according to the Justice Department. Dozens of individuals have been charged in connection with that case as of November.

The company is also weighing additional ways to shore up liquidity, including raising emergency financing or selling assets, the people said, asking not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly. Separately, some Saks lenders have held confidential talks in recent days to assess the company’s cash needs, according to other people familiar with the matter. Those discussions have focused on a potential debtor-in-possession loan, a form of bankruptcy funding.
Saks raised billions of dollars from bond investors late last year to finance a bold turnaround plan centered on the acquisition of Neiman Marcus, betting that scale would revive the struggling luxury retailer. Instead, the deal deepened the company’s debt burden and failed to resolve long-running issues with vendors, many of whom halted shipments amid missed payments, accelerating losses.
In June, Saks persuaded creditors to provide hundreds of millions of dollars more as part of a debt deal that reshuffled repayment priorities, creating multiple tiers of bondholders with differing claims on the company’s assets. Even those securities have since plunged, underscoring concern among investors that the turnaround effort is running out of time.
“Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future for Saks Global and advance our transformation while delivering exceptional products, elevated experiences and personalized service to our customers,” a representative for Saks said via email. PJT Partners, which is advising the company, declined to comment.
The tie-up with Neiman last year was intended to create a multibrand luxury giant powered by the technology of new high-profile investors, which included Amazon.com Inc. and Salesforce Inc. But by May, bondholders were already facing paper losses of more than $1 billion as the plan stumbled.
Following the restructuring, Saks in October cut its full-year guidance after reporting declining sales tied to inventory management challenges, as it continued to delay payments to some vendors to conserve cash.
Saks faces interest payments of more than $100 million due Dec. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $941 million portion of Saks’ second-out notes restructured in August were quoted at about 6 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, down from roughly 36 cents two weeks earlier, according to runs shared with Bloomberg. About $762 million of more senior debt was quoted at around 46 cents.
Saks had been owned by Hudson’s Bay, the historic Canadian retailer that liquidated locations this year after attempting to restructure.

Stocked with everything from pulses and condiments to baby diapers and skincare essentials, the store mirrors the breadth of the digital platform.
Designed as an experiential format, the outlet allows customers to walk in, browse the aisles, and shop much like they would in a traditional supermarket. This pilot initiative adds a compelling new dimension to online-first retail, and analysts suggest it could signal a shift in how the still-nascent quick commerce industry approaches growth amid intense competition.
Mintunpacks how the store functions, whether Swiggy Instamart stands to gain meaningfully, and what this could mean for quick commerce.
Located in the upscale neighbourhood of M3M 65th Avenue of Gurugram, the store stands in the midst of a host of residential and commercial properties, including large housing complexes.
At the outset, the store appears to be like any other department store—stocked with everyday products ranging from essentials such as pulses, fresh produce and grains to even nicotine products. Noice, Swiggy’s private label selling breads, paneer and snacks among other food items, also sits comfortably on the shelves.
The store is run by PYD Retail Pvt Ltd, a seller that operates on Swiggy Instamart’s online app as well. According to a person close to the company, the stores will continue to stock limited SKUs, especially in categories such as fresh fruit and vegetables that consumers may prefer to touch and test before purchasing.
Sellers are likely to use such stores to analyze what categories are likely to sell better and fulfil better demand forecasting and inventory control.
To be sure, Instamart does have separate dark stores or micro warehouses in the area to fulfil its online orders. Products available in the store are sold at MRP and a standee with a link to download the app is placed inside the store. The paper bags are Swiggy-branded, and there are no delivery or handling fees.
Branding could emerge as a meaningful revenue lever for Swiggy Instamart, especially as quick commerce platforms mature beyond pure delivery economics.
As growth in order volumes moderates across the sector, brands are increasingly willing to pay for visibility closer to the point of purchase, through preferred placement, in-store signage, or exclusive product launches.
A physical format also allows Instamart to monetize brand partnerships more directly, converting its rich consumer data and category dominance into high-margin advertising and co-marketing opportunities, said Datum’s Meena.
For an industry grappling with thin margins, branding-led revenue offers a way to offset logistics-heavy costs without relying solely on higher delivery fees or discounts.
Analysts believe the move does raise fundamental questions about the quick commerce model.
“Offline stores come with higher fixed costs, operational complexity, and slower scalability. These are challenges digital platforms were built to avoid. While the format may help Instamart test customer behaviour and brand visibility, it risks diluting the proposition of speed and convenience that defines quick commerce,” said Datum’s Meena.
Moreover, physical stores add limited incremental insight into consumer behaviour, given the vast amount of transaction and user data already available to quick commerce platforms.
“There are still many unknowns. The main questions are if Instamart is serious about offline retail, how exactly the branding exercise will work, and why was Gurugram chosen as the first market for the experiment. All of this will clarify the company’s plans and therefore, investor confidence,” Meena added.
Although it is unclear if Swiggy Instamart will expand this experiment, a hybrid format could change the whole dynamic of its business, according to Sandeep Abhange, research analyst at brokerage firm LKP Securities.
“The business case investors have backed is an internet-first model with minimal capital requirements beyond dark stores. Moving into physical retail reverses that logic will bring higher capex, operational drag, and potentially slower return,” Abhange noted.
However, the source quoted above noted that the move does not suggest a shift by Instamart to omnichannel retail. Currently, this is a focused consumer experiment for a single seller of Instamart, not a large-scale move into traditional retail, this person noted.

“The rum category in India is a significant and growing sector, with consumers increasingly gravitating toward richer, more complex dark rum expressions. This renewed appreciation for craftsmanship and depth makes it an exciting time to expand our presence in the segment,” said Abhishek Khaitan, Managing Director of Radico Khaitan.
On the taste palate, Radico Khaitan's Kohinoor Reserve opens up with rich sweet-fruity aromas which are balanced with spicy notes of dried fruits, roasted nuts and elegant woody undertones.
The company also said that the dark rum blend offers warmth without harshness while offering the complexity derived from the triple-cask maturation. The finish of the alcohol beverage is long, smooth and crafted exclusively for lovers of refined, high-quality dark rum.
The bottle also seeks to portray the same symbolism with a sculpted, multi-faceted structure, reminding one of the rare gemstone. The company also said that when you view the bottle from the top, the design will evoke an oval diamond silhouette, while the broad shoulders, strong base and muted gold detailing lend it a regal, contemporary character.
Radico Khaitan shares closed 0.11% higher at₹3,272.05 after Tuesday's stock market session, compared to₹3,268.55 at the previous market close, according to BSE data. The company announced the launch update during the market operating hours on 23 December 2025.

Ajanta, which gets over 40% of its revenue from these markets, has inked an agreement with Biocon to distribute generic semaglutide in 26 countries in Asia and Africa next year, as patents expire. Under the deal, Ajanta will procure the finished product—the semaglutide injectable pen—from Biocon and distribute it under its own brand exclusively in 23 countries and semi-exclusively in the three other countries, the company’s top executive toldMintin an interview.
Ajanta is betting on its strong ground presence in these markets, increasing demand and assured supply from Biocon to gain significant share overseas.
“It's a milestone moment for us,” said managing director Yogesh Agrawal. “We all know GLP-1s are doing exceptionally well. The total market for GLP-1s globally is about $55 billion. Historically, we have not seen any blockbuster product like this,” he said.
“We have a large footprint in the RoW (rest of the world) markets—in Africa, we are one of the largest players. In the Middle East, we have a very strong presence as well as in Central Asia and Southeast Asia,” Agrawal added.
Over a third of the company’s medical representatives—about 2,000 of its 5,600 reps—are based in these markets, giving it a significant stronghold.
“The idea with this tie-up is to join strength with them (Biocon) and take their product to emerging markets where they don't have a presence,” said Agrawal.
The market for generic semaglutide globally is expected to boom next year. About 40% of the world’s population and an estimated 33% of the world’s adults living with obesity are in countries where semaglutide’s patent expires next year, according to a note by IQVIA, a healthcare data and research company, in August.
The addressable opportunity for Ajanta is huge. Currently, the market for semaglutide, which so far has only sales from innovator Novo Nordisk, is $35 million-45 million in its 26 targeted countries, according to Ajanta’s estimates. However, the company estimates this could grow 10x in the next 2-3 years as patents expire and cheaper generics are allowed.
Generic pricing in these markets is not expected to be as low as Indian prices, which are expected to drop about 80-90%, according to analyst estimates.
“From an on-ground perspective, the company is well-equipped, given their branded generics strength in both Africa and Asia emerging markets,” said Shrikant Akolkar, a pharma analyst at Nuvama Institutional Equities.
“We do not know the pricing for the drug yet, but what we understand is that the pricing may remain very attractive because the API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) prices and cost of fill-finish required for the drug are low. Additionally, emerging markets have a growing prevalence of obesity, which also remains untreated. Going by that, emerging markets will be a profitable proposition for many companies,” Akolkar said.
Distribution is very important in these markets, said Akolkar, giving the company an edge.
While the market may not be as crowded as India is expected to be, the competition will be tight.
“The entry value is very high in terms of the device, the dedicated specialized plant and the study investment which you have to do. So, I think only a handful of companies, maybe less than a dozen, would want to take that kind of concentrated bet on the capex and the studies,” said Agrawal.
The company is banking on its salesforce—among the highest for an Indian company overseas—and Biocon’s R&D and manufacturing expertise, to be among the top five players in its targeted markets.
The company will start regulatory filings for these markets in early 2026 and expects gains to start coming in from calendar year 2027. Ajanta is also looking at an India launch and is in talks with a separate partner.

Bangur, 72, the chairman of Shree Cement, is unfazed by the acquisition spree of his peers, Aditya Birla Group’s UltraTech and Gautam Adani’s Ambuja Cements. He is in no hurry, avoiding the bidding wars and opting instead for organic growth. “It is never a question of size. It is a matter of efficiency,” he believes.
Bangur sat down withMintfor a rare interview at his house near Mumbai’s Peddar Road—other residents in the area, also called the ‘billionaires row’, are Mukesh Ambani and Sajjan Jindal.
Unlike the skyscrapers that dot the neighbourhood, Bangur’s home is a two-storeyed haveli called Mohini Mahal. Dressed in a fading lavender polo shirt and black, loose-fitting trousers, one would be forgiven for mistaking the septuagenarian businessman for a retired professor sharing his time-tested thesis with the three scribes. But under that mild demeanour hides one of the corporate sector’s shrewdest strategists.
Returns are also low because cement is highly capital-intensive. A₹3,000 crore plant generates only about₹1,000 crore in revenue, while Ebitda is₹250 crore at a margin of 25%. So in reality, it is just a 7-8% return on capital, which is barely enough to service debt and interest. In our case, in the absence of interest outgo, there is no major cash strain. While the industry may be going through some bad times, we are insulated from it.
Even at normal prices, setting up or buying a cement factory does not generate enough returns. That is why we have largely avoided inorganic growth. Many companies have expanded through acquisitions, and while it looks impressive in newspapers and on social media, the real issue is debt. How much debt can you take on, and how much capacity does it actually give you?
Inorganic growth is expensive. On average, you have to pay a 50% premium compared to setting up a new plant. In the short term, you may get capacity faster, but over 10 years, the same money can give you more capacity through organic growth. Another issue is that with acquisitions, growth depends on what assets are available and where. With organic growth, you choose the geography and plan ahead. I can pay at most a 10% premium over the cost of setting up a new unit. Anything beyond that I will not be able to pay.
Nothing will come cheap. Assets may be available, but someone will always be willing to pay a premium, and I will not be one of them. When I talk about increasing our capacity from 68 million tonnes to 80 million tonnes, I am talking about nearly 20% growth over two-three years. That is good enough. Our growth plans are not weak and we are simply choosing a different route. The real question is how we reached 68 million tonnes from 30 or 40 million tonnes, and over how many years. We also need to see whether those who have grown through acquisitions have grown faster than us, or if our growth rate is below the industry average. That comparison matters more than the method.
There is an overemphasis on acquisition-led growth in many people’s minds. But with acquisitions, my normal investment plan gets disrupted. My energy suddenly goes into managing the acquired plant, and setting up a new plant becomes a non-starter. In the end, overall growth suffers.
Our growth rate is much better than the industry. That itself shows whatever we are doing is working. Our advantage lies in low-cost production and continuously upgrading and building new, modern plants with the latest technology. I don’t think I will ever be able to buy old capacity, unless it is available at a clear discount.
The point is, nobody is wrong. Every company has its own philosophy. They want to grow immediately and don’t want to wait. They have the confidence and the muscle power to revive it (old plants). We don’t. UltraTech is the only company with such a high bandwidth of management. Even if it takes a company five years to revive, they will be able to take care of it. Second, for Adani, who came into the industry in September 2022, it is too early. Without a 10-year history, we cannot say whether they are doing good work or not.
Of course, they have many advantages. They have synergies from their other businesses like ports, power and coal, but those advantages have to reflect in their (financial) numbers. Their profit numbers are normal. The advantage is not visible yet. Still, my previous statement stands: three years is a small time frame. Let us give them 10 years before we judge. Only the future will justify whether paying such a high premium (for acquisitions) makes sense.
It is never a question of size. It is a matter of efficiency. Smaller player or bigger player, if you are efficient, you will survive. Smaller companies have many advantages too. Everything is in their control first hand. Freight goes up immediately and the bell rings in the owner’s mind and you can take immediate corrective steps. As you grow bigger, efficiencies and inefficiencies both build up. We talk only of the efficiency that size brings, but size inefficiencies are also there.
If we are using 35 million tonnes of limestone, we have to add at least 500 million tonnes to our reserve because this is a non-renewable resource. Once the limestone is finished, it is finished. We may consume in Rajasthan and add in Maharashtra. Overall, in India, we want to have 10 times more limestone reserves (than what we consume). For this reason, if I acquire one or two mines every year; that is more than sufficient.
It is low. Over the last year and a half, we were selling cement in good volumes but at the cheapest rates. Because our costs were low, we were able to pass on the benefit and still make a reasonable profit. But then we suddenly realized that India has changed. Consumers now seem to believe that only things that are more costly will be good. So, we increased our prices. Our price journey has now stabilized. Now we will increase our volume. We will maintain these prices so the volume will pick up again. When we have sufficient volume, we will see if we can further reduce the price gap.
The 60% capacity utilization will not increase much, as we are continuously adding many plants. Old plants will have a higher capacity than new plants. If the plant started in the last three months, its capacity utilization will be 5-10%, so overall capacity utilization will be 66% for one or two years.
Price discipline is effectively the same as price control or price manipulation. There is no such thing in reality. Every company is at a different stage. Someone may need cash tomorrow for wealth distribution, and will they listen if I tell them not to sell at a discount tomorrow, since prices might be a little higher the day after? Price discipline will never truly exist. Ultimately, prices are determined by market supply and demand.
Yes, the entire environment seems to praise you for being exceptionally intelligent, be it your son, employees or friends. Because they only count my successes. So, an independent test gave me enough confidence—whether I can still work or if I should retire. I have stopped now because the course has changed. So many new things have come up. (After taking the test) I suddenly feel semiliterate from highly literate (laughs).
Buffett is a much higher grade (investor). My success story is that I bought 5% of Orient Cement and kept it for 4-5 years. I purchased it at a very low price and after the company changed hands (acquired by the Adani Group in 2024), I sold it for₹350 a share. My thesis was simple. It was a good company with a very low market cap. I knew Mr (C.K.) Birla would never be a desperate seller, but he would sell one day because of succession planning.
I have met Warren personally though. He had invited about 30 students from the management school of IIT (Indian Institute of Technology), Kharagpur. I offered to sponsor their tickets if me and three of my friends could also join. The IIT dean said this won’t be allowed. So I leaked this information to the students—that this is my offer and your dean is saying no. The dean was then pressurized into agreeing. It was much cheaper (laughs). Going to the (famous Berkshire Hathaway) AGM (annual general meeting) would have been four times more expensive. And here, he met everybody individually. He gave us a lot of time. This was about 12 years back.
So, at that time, I asked, ‘Why don’t you invest in India, sir?’ He said ‘Whatever I invest, the returns won’t move the needle on my overall portfolio. It is such a small market. Why should I invest here?’ It is a different story today.
